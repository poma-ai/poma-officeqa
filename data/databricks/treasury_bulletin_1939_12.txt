"Total outstanding issues" of tax-exempt securities of the several borrowers differs from the gross indebtedness of those borrowers in that it excludes noninterest-bearing and taxable interest-bearing debt. "Net outstanding issues" differs from net indebtedness in that it excludes from "total outstanding issues" tax-exempt securities held by governments, governmental agencies, Federal Reserve banks, and public sinking, trust and investment funds, while net debt excludes from gross debt the total volume of sinking fund assets, regardless of their character, but ignores all other public assets. Tax-exempt securities are segregated into 2 categories, those partially exempt and those wholly exempt. The former are exempt from the normal rates and the latter from both the normal and the surtax rates of the Federal income tax. United States savings bonds and Treasury bonds are here classified as partially tax-exempt securities. However, it is to be noted that by statutory provision, interest derived from $5,000 of principal amount of these securities owned by any single holder is exempt from the surtax as well as the normal tax. The estimate of the volume of tax-exempt securities outstanding on June 30, 1939, is based in part on a questionnaire survey of State, local, territorial, and insular debt and specified funds, conducted by the Treasury Department in cooperation with the Department of the Interior Division of Territories and Island Possessions, and in part on the record of new security issues published by the COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL CHRONICLE.

1/ And is associated with a plan on the theory of a tax shift, in the spirit of the common law rule that "a man is not taxed in the absence of Nation-wide trust and investment fund data for 1938 and 1939, it was assumed that the tax-exempt security holdings of these funds increased 5 percent during each of the last 2 fiscal years. This assumption was based on pre-1937 trends for States and cities and on available fragmentary data for 1938.

Statutory Debt Limitation

Section 21 of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, provides that the face amount of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, Treasury bills, and Treasury notes issued under authority of that Act "shall not exceed in the aggregate $45,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time." The following table shows the face amount of obligations outstanding on December 15, 1939, and the face amount which can still be issued under this limitation. This limitation does not include War-savings certificates authorized by Section 6. Figures are preliminary on basis of daily Treasury statements.
