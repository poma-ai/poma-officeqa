Profile of the Economy

[Source: Office of Macroeconomic Analysis]

As of February 19, 2010

Introduction

The economy expanded for a second straight quarter in the last 3 months of 2009, after a year and a half of nearly steady contraction. Financial as well as economic conditions have stabilized, and improvement in economic activity has become much more broad-based; final sales have risen for three straight quarters. Labor market conditions also improved in 2009, but the job market remains very weak and recovery in employment this year is likely to be slow and to lag behind GDP growth.

Measured on a 12-month basis, headline consumer prices were down in 8 of the 12 months of 2009, reflecting the substantial decline in oil and commodity prices from peak levels reached in summer 2008. Core inflation (a measure excluding food and energy prices) has remained well-contained for over a year, held in check by excess capacity and labor market slack. Conditions in housing have been stabilizing and financial markets have been improving for about a year. Stock market indexes posted double-digit gains last year, but have been roughly flat to somewhat lower in the current year to date. Treasury bond yields have remained fairly steady for the past several months. Most economists predict moderate economic growth through 2010. The economy has been supported by a wide variety of measures implemented under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or the “Recovery Act”), as well as efforts to restore financial stability and improve conditions in housing markets. Although some of these measures are being further enhanced, most of the fiscal stimulus will have been implemented by the end of this year; in addition, most of the special monetary policy supports will be removed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.

Growth

Economic conditions continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009. Real GDP rose at a strong 5.7 percent annual rate, following a 2.2 percent rise in the third quarter. A sharp slowdown in inventory liquidation accounted for much of the surge, contributing 3.4 percentage points to fourth quarter growth. Excluding inventories, final sales rose a solid 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter and nearly every major component of GDP grew. Consumer spending, residential investment, and exports each rose for the second straight quarter. Business investment grew for the first time since mid-2008: purchases of equipment and software rose at the fastest pace since early 2006, although business spending on structures fell further. Government spending edged down in the fourth quarter, as a small decline in state

(Quarterly percent change at annual rate)

and local government expenditures more than offset a 0.1 percent increase in federal outlays.

Over the four quarters of 2009, consumer spending-which accounts for about 70 percent of GDP–rose by 1.1 percent, following a 1.8 percent decline the previous year (the largest four-quarter drop in this GDP component since 1974). Consumer spending rose 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, slowing from the third quarter's 2.8 percent rise, but still contributing 1.4 percentage points to real GDP growth.

Residential investment–mostly residential homebuilding–now accounts for only about 3-1/2 percent of GDP after falling sharply since early 2006. After several quarters of steep declines, residential investment surged 19 percent in the third quarter of 2009, and grew by a more moderate 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Monthly housing measures (starts, sales, inventories, and prices) remain weak, but signs of recovery are emerging. In January, single-family starts were up 36 percent from a year earlier, but were still running at less than half of 2007’s pace. Likewise, sales of existing single family homes posted a record monthly decline of 16.7 percent in December, but the level is still above that of August 2009, the month before the first-time homebuyer tax incentive began boosting sales significantly. By July 2009, new single family home sales had climbed to a level 27 percent above their January 2009 lows. Although levels have since trended lower, and sales fell 7.6 percent in December, the level remains above the January low. Inventories of unsold new and existing homes continued to shrink in December. The number of unsold new single-family homes is at a 38-year low.

PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY

Higher levels of home sales and declining inventories have helped stabilize house prices; 12-month declines in prices have slowed. The Federal Housing Financing Authority (FHFA) purchase-only house price index has been stable since November 2008 and rose 0.7 percent in November 2009. On a 12-month basis, the index rose 5 percent—the first yearly gain in over 2 years. The Standard & Poor’s (S&P)/Case-Shiller composite home price indexes edged down in November, but the year-over-year declines slowed to 4.5 percent (10-city index) and to 5.3 percent (20-city index), the smallest decreases in 2-1/2 years.

Business activity outside of homebuilding declined in 2008 and the first three quarters of 2009, including a record plunge during the first quarter. The pace of decline moderated during 2009, however, and in the fourth quarter, nonresidential fixed investment—about 10 percent of GDP—grew by nearly 3 percent at an annual rate. Outlays for equipment and software increased more than 13 percent in the fourth quarter, although investment in structures fell by over 15 percent. Altogether, business fixed investment added 0.4 percentage point to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, the first positive contribution since the second quarter of 2007.

Exports account for about 12 percent of GDP, while imports, which are subtracted from GDP, account for about 17 percent. Export growth was a key driver of overall economic growth in 2007 and most of 2008, but as the world-wide recession worsened exports declined. However, the decline in exports was more than matched by declines in imports. In the fourth quarter of 2009, exports grew by more than 18 percent (after rising at nearly that pace in the third quarter). Imports grew 10.5 percent (slowing from the 21 percent pace of the previous quarter) and net exports contributed 0.5 percentage point to fourth quarter growth in real GDP.

Although the U.S. trade balance (which measures trade in goods and services) and the current account (which also includes investment income flows and unilateral transfers) remain in deficit, both deficits have narrowed appreciably in recent years. The merchandise trade deficit reached $840 billion in 2008, but declined to $517 billion in 2009. The current account balance has been in deficit almost continuously since the early 1980s, and in 2006, reached a record $804 billion, equivalent to 6.0 percent of GDP. In the third quarter of 2009, (latest data available) the current account deficit had narrowed further to about $430 billion, equivalent to 3.0 percent of GDP.

Public sector purchases—which account for roughly 20 percent of GDP—edged down 0.2 percent at an annual rate in

the fourth quarter, making virtually no contribution to GDP growth. Federal spending edged up 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, after jumping by 11 percent and 8 percent in the second and third quarters, respectively. State and local government spending fell 0.3 percent, after declining by 0.6 percent in the third quarter.

Labor Markets

Labor market conditions deteriorated through 2008 and worsened during the first part of 2009, but conditions moderated through January 2010. From the beginning of the recession in December 2007 through January 2010, 8.4 million jobs have been lost, including roughly 4.8 million jobs in 2009 alone. Nonfarm payrolls fell by an average of 753,000 per month during the first quarter of 2009, but job losses started to slow in the second quarter, such that by the end of January 2010, the average decline in employment was just 35,000. The unemployment rate generally trended higher during 2009, peaking at 10.1 percent in October—a 26-year high and 5.7 percentage points above the March 2007 low of 4.4 percent. By January 2010, the unemployment rate had declined to 9.7 percent. A measure of unemployment that includes workers who are underemployed and those who are only marginally attached to the labor force reached a record high of 17.4 percent in October 2009 (series dates from 1994)—nearly double its level of 8.8 percent in December 2007. This broader measure declined to 16.5 percent in January 2010.

Job losses have been spread broadly across most sectors; from the start of the recession through January 2010, construction payrolls fell 1.9 million, transportation payrolls fell by more than 400,000, and payrolls in the leisure/hospitality and finance/insurance/real estate sectors each fell by roughly 600,000. While the labor market still remains weak, signs of stability have emerged in several sectors. For example, although manufacturing payrolls declined by 2.1 million from the start of the recession through December 2009, manufacturing employment rose by 11,000 in January 2010, the first increase for this series in 3 years. Federal Government employment increased 33,000 in January, and employment in private service-producing industries, including retail trade and temporary help, rose by 48,000. A few sectors have seen job growth throughout the recession: since December 2007, the health care and education sectors have together added nearly 800,000 payroll jobs, including a net gain of about 550,000 jobs in health care.

Inflation

Headline inflation peaked at 5.6 percent in the year through July 2008, boosted by surging food and energy prices. Since then, the headline measure has retreated noticeably on a 12-month basis, mainly due to declines in energy prices, persistent economic slack, and to a lesser extent, slowing food price inflation. On a 12 month basis, energy prices were down 14 percent through October 2009, but more recent price increases were reflected in the 19.1 percent rise in the energy index in the year through January 2010. Headline consumer prices fell on a 12-month basis in 8 of 12 months last year, but were up 2.6 percent in the year through January 2010, well above the zero rate in the year ending January 2009. For the most recent 3 months, headline consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent (with energy prices rising nearly 26 percent at an annual rate over the same period). Core consumer prices (excluding food and energy) rose by 1.6 percent in the year through January 2010, slightly slower than the rise in the previous year through January 2009. In the 3 months ending in January 2010, the rate of core price inflation was zero, indicating underlying inflation pressures remain well-contained.

Oil prices have risen since late 2008, but are well-below the record highs reached in mid-summer 2008. The retail price of regular gasoline hit a record of $4.11 per gallon in early July 2008, then dropped to $1.61 in late December 2008. As of mid-February 2010 the price had risen to $2.61 per gallon, $1.00 higher than the December 2008 low and nearly 65 cents higher than a year ago. The front-month futures price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil traded to a record $147 per barrel in mid-July 2008, but has

since dropped and averaged just under $80 per barrel in January 2010.

Food prices rose rapidly over much of 2007 and 2008, remaining above the overall inflation rate, but have since declined. In the 12 months through January 2010, consumer food prices fell 0.4 percent, contrasting sharply with the 5.3 percent rise of the previous year.

Federal Budget

The federal budget deficit widened to $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009 (10 percent of GDP), well above the $459 billion in fiscal year 2008 (3.2 percent of GDP). This deterioration followed 3 years of improvement that had trimmed the deficit to $162 billion (1.2 percent of GDP) in fiscal year 2007.

New economic and budget projections were released early in 2010 as part of the Fiscal Year 2011 Budget. The federal budget is projected to show a deficit of $1,556 billion in fiscal year 2010 which is $143 billion higher than last year's deficit of $1,413 billion. The fiscal year 2010 deficit is projected to be 10.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2010, the highest percentage since 1945 (when it was 22 percent). The deficit is projected to shrink by $289 billion in fiscal 2011 to $1,267 billion and continue to diminish each year through 2014. The deficit as a share of GDP declines to 3.9 percent by 2015 and continues to decline to 3.6 percent of GDP through 2018. During 2016-2020, the deficit is projected to average 3.8 percent of GDP. Much of that deficit is due to interest costs. The primary deficit—receipts less spending excluding interest payments—averages 0.5 percent of GDP during 2016-2020.

Economic Policy

Key fiscal and monetary policy actions taken over the past few years have kept the economy from contracting even further, and continue to set the stage for recovery in 2010 and beyond.

On the fiscal policy side, the ARRA authorizes the government to spend $787 billion towards stimulating domestic demand, including $288 billion in tax benefits, $275 billion in contracts, grants, and loans, and $224 billion in entitlements. As of late January 2010, a total of more than $270 billion in funds had been paid out. This spending will continue to provide an important boost to economic activity in 2010. Specifically, the Recovery Act is expected to create or save an estimated 3.5 million jobs in a range of industries from clean energy to health care. The ARRA is also helping to bolster incomes and support consumer spending: government estimates suggest that as of May 2009, nominal disposable personal income was about $207 billion (nearly 2 percent) higher than it otherwise would have been without the Making Work Pay tax cuts or the one-time payments to eligible recipients (mostly Social Security recipients). More recently, the government announced an extension of the first-time home buyer tax credit as well as a new Small Business Jobs and Wages Tax Credit.

Partly in response to rising financial market stress, as well as signs of more slowing in the broader economy, the Federal Reserve began easing monetary policy in August 2007. It has since cut the rate dramatically to a target range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent at the December 2008 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which brought the target to its lowest level in history.

maintained at the FOMC's most recent meeting in late January 2010, when the Committee observed continued strengthening in economic activity, supportive financial market conditions, and subdued inflation. The Federal Reserve responded to financial market stresses and the weakened economy by significantly expanding its tools to increase liquidity in credit markets and easing lending terms to sectors that needed a temporary injection. These include a variety of facilities and funds directed at specific financial markets, including commercial paper and money market funds. At the most recent FOMC meeting, the Committee reaffirmed its schedule for removing these supports. Purchases of about $300 billion of Treasury securities were already completed at the end of October 2009, and most of the special liquidity facilities were closed on February 1, 2010, including the temporary swap arrangements with foreign central banks. The final auction for the Term Auction Facility (TAF) will be on March 8, 2010. The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain June 30, 2010 (for commercial mortgage-backed securities), and March 31, 2010 (for loans backed by all other types of collateral).

On an inter-meeting basis, the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors announced in mid-February that, "in light of continued improvement in financial market conditions" it had unanimously approved several modifications to the terms of its discount window lending programs. The most notable change was the increase in the discount rate from 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The Board also announced that it was shortening the typical maximum maturity for primary credit loans to overnight, and was raising the minimum bid rate for the TAF by 0.25 percentage point to 0.50 percentage point.

Financial Markets

Financial markets came under unprecedented stress in the fall of 2008, but a wide range of financial stability measures and the boost to the economy through the ARRA have helped stabilize markets. Credit flows began picking up early in 2009 and have since improved substantially; measures of risk tolerance and volatility have largely returned to pre-crisis levels.

The S&P 500 index rose 23.5 percent in 2009, rebounding from a 38.5 percent plunge in 2008, the sharpest loss since 1931 (when an earlier version of the index, containing only 90 stocks, dropped 47 percent). Measured from the S&P 500's 12-year low in mid-March 2009, the index surged 65 percent through the end of that year. Thus far in 2010, however, the index has declined by about 1.0 percent. The S&P stock market volatility index (VIX), often used as a measure of financial market uncertainty, surged to an all-time high of 80 percent in late October 2008, after hovering in a range of 20 to 30 percent for most of 2008. The VIX has since retreated, and as of mid-February 2010, stood at about 23 percent.

Long-Term Interest Rate Spreads

Long-term Treasury interest rates have responded to a variety of factors, including flight-to-quality flows in response to financial market pressures, as well as concerns about the increase in supply that will be necessary to fund the government's emergency support programs. After trading between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent for most of 2008, the yield dropped off sharply starting in mid-November 2008, reaching a low of 2.1 percent in late December 2008. Since then, the 10-year note yield has generally trended higher, and over the past several months has traded in a more stable range. The yield stood at about 3.8 percent as of mid-February 2010. The 3-month Treasury bill yield, by contrast, generally trended lower throughout 2008 under the relatively steady influence of safe-haven demand for short-term liquid assets. The yield fell almost to zero-reaching a record low-by the end of December 2008, but rose during the first half of 2009, trading in the range of 0.2 percent. Since late August 2009, however, the 3-month yield has declined, trading to a low of 0.02 percent as recently as mid-December 2009. Since then, the rate has trended somewhat higher, and reached 0.10 percent in mid-February 2010. The 2- to 10-year Treasury yield spread, one measure of the steepness of the yield curve, widened noticeably starting in mid-2007, when it was roughly 20 basis points, to an average 280 basis points in January 2010. In the current economic environment, a steepening yield curve may suggest a higher probability of economic recovery.

Short-Term Interest Rate Spreads

Key interest rates on private securities, which spiked in response to financial market turbulence in late 2008, have since retraced as conditions have stabilized. The spread between the 3-month London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the 3-month Treasury bill rate (the TED spread, a measure of inter-bank liquidity and credit risk) had averaged less than 50 basis points before the crisis began to worsen in August 2007 and rose to an all-time high of nearly 460 basis points in early October 2008. Improvements in short-term credit availability narrowed the spread to about 15 basis points in late September 2009, but the spread had widened to 25 basis points in mid-November, before retracing again to 15 basis points as of mid-February. The spread between the Baa corporate bond yield and the 10-year Treasury yield averaged 170 basis points through most of 2007, before the financial market turmoil emerged. It peaked at nearly 620 basis points in December 2008 and has subsequently narrowed. However, since September 2009, this spread has remained in the range of 250 to 300 basis points (it stood at 270 basis points in mid-February 2010)-still very high by historical standards.

Rates for conforming mortgages have remained relatively stable over the past several months, and jumbo mortgage rates have started to trend lower. The interest rate for a 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgage rose to about 5.5 percent at the end of 2009, but has since trended lower, reaching 5.2 percent as of mid-February.

Foreign Exchange Rates

The value of the U.S. dollar compared with the currencies of seven major trading partners (the euro area countries, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, and Switzerland) has depreciated significantly from its peak in February 2002, but most recently, has begun to stabilize. Between February 2002 and January 2009, the exchange value of the dollar compared to an index of these currencies fell by about 16 percent. Between October 2007 and October 2009, however, the dollar appreciated by roughly 4.0 percent against these currencies.

timeframe, the dollar depreciated by about 33 percent against the yen, and by 34 percent against the euro. Over the past 2 years, the dollar has depreciated by about 16 percent against the yen, but has appreciated by about 3.0 percent against the euro. The dollar has appreciated against an index of currencies of 19 other important trading partners (including China, India, and Mexico). Between February 2002 and January 2009, the dollar firmed by about 1 percent against this basket of currencies, and over the past 2 years, appreciated by about 5.0 percent.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usually takes the form of appropriations that allow obligations to be incurred and payments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have expired or would otherwise expire. These are counted as new budget authority in the fiscal year of the legislation in which the reappropriation act is included, regardless of when the amounts were originally appropriated or when they would otherwise lapse.

Obligations generally are liquidated by the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash—outlays. Obligations may also be liquidated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned-income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts. Total Government receipts are compared with total outlays in calculating the budget surplus or deficit.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipt accounts). The former normally can be used without an appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements to appropriations. For accounting purposes, earned reimbursements are also known as revenues. These offsetting collections are netted against gross outlays in determining net outlays from such appropriations; and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust); offsetting collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into three categories: (1) proprietary receipts, or collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function; (2) intragovernmental transactions, or payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts. They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts; and (3) offsetting governmental receipts that include foreign cash contributions.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions—payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and outlays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept set forth in the "Report of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts" as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1969. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government's fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them outside of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Postal Service.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit ordinarily are not subject to targets set by the Congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (2 United States Code 900-922)] included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused on both on- and off-budget receipts, outlays and deficit of the Government.

FEDERAL FISCAL OPERATIONS

Tables FFO-1, FFO-2, and FFO-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, estimates for 2 years detail for 13 months, and fiscal year-to-date data. They provide a summary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal entities and disbursing officers, and daily reports from the FRBs. They also detail accounting transactions affecting receipts and outlays of the Government and off-budget Federal entities and their related effect on assets and liabilities of the Government. Data are derived from the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government."

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets, and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FFO-2 includes on- and off-budget receipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FFO-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FFO-4 summarizes on- and off-budget receipts by source and outlays by function as reported to each major fund group classification for the current fiscal year to date and prior fiscal year to date.

Table FFO-5 summarizes internal revenue receipts by states and by type of tax. Amounts reported are collections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), payments made with tax returns and subsequent payments made after tax returns are due or are filed (that is, payments with delinquent returns or on delinquent accounts).

Amounts are reported based on the primary filing address provided by each taxpayer or reporting entity. For multistate corporations, the address may reflect only the district where such a corporation reported its taxes from a principal office rather than other districts where income was earned or where individual income and Social Security taxes were withheld. In addition, an individual may reside in one district and work in another.

Table FFO-6 includes customs collection of duties, taxes, and fees by districts and ports.

First-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 supplements fiscal data reported in the December issue of the “Treasury Bulletin.” At the time of that issue’s release, not enough data were available to analyze adequately collections for the quarter.

Individual income taxes—Individual income tax receipts, net of refunds, were $207.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. This is a decrease of $47.6 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Withheld receipts decreased by $34.8 billion and non-withheld receipts decreased by $3.3 billion during this period. Refunds increased by $9.5 billion over the comparable fiscal year 2009 quarter. There was an increase of $2.6 billion in accounting adjustments between individual income tax receipts and the Social Security and Medicare trust funds over the comparable quarter in fiscal year 2009.

Corporate income taxes—Net corporate income tax receipts were $33.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. This is a decrease of $16.4 billion compared to the prior

year first quarter. The $16.4 billion change is comprised of a decrease of $7.9 billion in estimated and final payments, and an increase of $8.6 billion in corporate refunds.

Employment taxes and contributions—Employment taxes and contributions receipts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $189.0 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Federal Disability Insurance, and Federal Hospital Insurance trust funds changed by -$1.1 billion, -$0.2 billion, and -$3.3 billion respectively. There was a -$10.4 billion accounting adjustment for prior years employment tax liabilities made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, while there was a -$7.8 billion adjustment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Unemployment insurance—Unemployment insurance receipts, net of refunds, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $5.4 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion over the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2009. Net State taxes deposited in the U.S. Treasury increased by $0.4 billion to $4.8 billion. Net Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes decreased by $0.1 billion to $0.6 billion.

These receipts represent a decrease of $2.6 billion over the same quarter in fiscal year 2009.

Contributions for other insurance and retirement—Contributions for other retirement were $1.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. This was a negligible change from the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Customs duties—Customs duties net of refunds were $5.9 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. This is a decrease of $1.0 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Excise taxes—Net excise tax receipts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $16.3 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Total excise tax refunds for the quarter were $0.5 billion, an increase of $0.1 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Miscellaneous receipts—Net miscellaneous receipts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 were $24.3 billion, an increase of $10.5 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. This change is due in part to deposits of earnings by Federal Reserve banks increasing by $9.5 billion.

Estate and gift taxes—Net estate and gift tax receipts were $4.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010

INTRODUCTION: Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The Department of the Treasury's (Treasury's) operating cash is maintained in accounts with the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs) and branches, as well as in tax and loan accounts in other financial institutions. Major information sources include FRBs, Treasury Regional Financial Centers, Internal Revenue Service Centers, Bureau of the Public Debt, and various electronic systems. As the FRB accounts are depleted, funds are called in (withdrawn) from thousands of tax and loan accounts at financial institutions throughout the country.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147 (codified at 31 United States Code 323), Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositaries maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan (TT&L) investment program, depositary financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate. Financial institutions wishing to retain funds deposited into their tax

and loan accounts in interest-bearing obligations can participate. The program permits Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in TT&L depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way, Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuating operations on TT&L financial institution reserves and on the economy. Likewise, those institutions wishing to remit the funds to the Treasury account at FRBs do so as collector depositaries.

Deposits to tax and loan accounts occur as customers of financial institutions deposit tax payments that the financial institutions use to purchase Government securities. In most cases, this involves a transfer of funds from a customer's account to the tax and loan account in the same financial institution. Also, Treasury can direct the FRBs to invest excess funds in tax and loan accounts directly from the Treasury account at the FRBs.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities issued by other Federal agencies accounting for the rest. Tables in this section of the “Treasury Bulletin” reflect the total. Further detailed information is published in the “Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States.” Likewise, information on agency securities and on investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" tables FD-2 and FD-6 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States."

Table FD-1 summarizes the Federal debt by listing public debt and agency securities held by the public, including the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agencies, largely by the Social Security and other Federal retirement trust funds. The net unamortized premium and discount also are listed by total Federal securities, securities held by Government accounts and securities held by the public. The difference between the outstanding face value of the Federal debt and the net unamortized premium and discount is classified as the accrual amount. (For greater detail on holdings of Federal securities by particular classes of investors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type, that is, marketable and nonmarketable, the total public debt securities outstanding that are held by the public.

In table FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by issues to particular funds within Government. Many of the funds invest in par value special series nonmarketables at interest rates determined by law. Others invest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents interest-bearing securities issued by Government agencies. Federal agency borrowing

has declined in recent years, in part because the Federal Financing Bank has provided financing to other Federal agencies. (Federal agency borrowing from Treasury is presented in the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”)

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt.

In March 1971, Congress enacted a limited exception to the amount of bonds with rates greater than 4-1/4 percent that could be held by the public. This permitted Treasury to offer securities maturing in more than 7 years at current market interest rates for the first time since 1965. In March 1976, the definition of a bond was changed to include those securities longer than 10 years to maturity. This exception has expanded since 1971, authorizing Treasury to continue to issue long-term securities. The ceiling on Treasury bonds was repealed on November 10, 1988.

The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the FRBs.

In table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Public Debt Operations

Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment, and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each outstanding marketable security is listed in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." The information in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" pertains only to marketable Treasury securities.

Table PDO-1 presents the results of weekly auctions of 4-, 13-, and 26-week bills. Treasury bills mature each Thursday. Issues of 4- and 13-week bills are reopenings of 26-week bills. High yields on accepted tenders and the dollar value of total bids are presented, with the dollar value of awards made on both competitive and noncompetitive bases.

To encourage the participation of individuals and smaller institutions, Treasury accepts noncompetitive tenders of up to $5 million for bills and $5 million for notes and bonds in each auction of securities.

Table PDO-2 lists the results of auctions of marketable securities, other than weekly bills, in chronological order over the past 2 years. Issues of cash management bills also are presented.

Note: Additional information, including maturity schedules of interest-bearing marketable public debt securities other than regular weekly and 52-week Treasury bills outstanding, can now be found on the Bureau of Public Debt's website at http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/pd_pdotables_downloadable_files.htm.

Note: On April 30, 2008, Treasury announced the reintroduction of the 52-week bill. The first auction of this security took place on June 3, 2008.

Note: Cash managements bills that are identified below are issued as part of the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP). For more details about the SFP, visit www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1144.htm or call 202-622-2960.

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, notes, and bonds that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. [See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.]

Effective January 1, 2001, Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt revised formats, titles, and column headings in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States," Table I: Summary of Treasury Securities Outstanding and Table II: Statutory Debt Limit. These changes should reduce confusion and bring the publication more in line with the public's use of terms.

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" table OFS-1 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Effective June 2001, FMS revised procedures and categories in this table to agree with the Bureau of the Public Debt's publication changes.

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and nonmarketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the FRBs, and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The FRBs acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated ownership of U.S. Treasury securities. Information is primarily obtained from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds data, Table L209. State, local, and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and foreign official accounts. They also include municipal, foreign official, and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes to the table for description of investor categories.)

INTRODUCTION: Market Yields

The table in this section presents yields on Treasury marketable securities for maturities ranging from 1 month to 30 years.

Table MY-1 lists Treasury market bid yields at constant maturities for bills, notes, and bonds. These Constant Maturity Treasury rates (CMTs) are interpolated from the Treasury yield curve and published daily at Treasury's Domestic Finance web site, www.ustreas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/yield.shtml. The yield curve is fitted daily using a hermite cubic spline. For inputs, Treasury primarily uses the bid yields of the on-the-run securities (most recently auctioned Treasury securities in all maturity tranches that Treasury currently auctions) as quoted in the secondary bond market as of approximately 3:30 p.m. each trading day. CMT yields are based on semiannual interest payments and are read at constant maturity points to develop a consistent data series.

The quotations used by Treasury to calculate the bid yields and fit the yield curve are obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System also publishes the Treasury constant maturity data series in its weekly Statistical Release H.15.

Treasury discontinued the 30-year constant maturity yield during the time period February 18, 2002, through February 8, 2006. Thus, 30-year yields for that time frame are not available.

Note: This is the last time the MY Data will appear in the Treasury Bulletin. It can be found on the Office of Debt Management’s Web site at: http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/.

INTRODUCTION: U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation

The U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation (USCC) statement informs the public of the total face value of currency and coin used as a medium of exchange that is in circulation at the end of a given accounting month. The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion deemed to be in circulation. It includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate or that may do so to a limited extent. Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various issues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census. USCC information has been published by Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when it was incorporated into the “Treasury Bulletin.” The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs), and the Federal Reserve Board.

1 Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) adopted a technique for valuing the special drawing right (SDR) based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and reserve position in the IMF also are valued on this basis beginning July 1974.
2 Treasury values its gold stock at $42.2222 per fine troy ounce and pursuant to 31 United

States Code 5117 (b) issues gold certificates to the Federal Reserve at the same rate against all gold held.

Includes allocations of SDRs in the Special Drawing Account in the IMF, plus or minus transactions in SDRs. Recent allocations are as follows: August 2009—$43,069 million and September 2009—$4,529 million.

4 Includes holdings of Treasury and Federal Reserve System; beginning November 1978, these are valued at current market exchange rates or, where appropriate, at such other rates as may be agreed upon by the parties to the transactions. Excludes outstanding reciprocal currency swaps with foreign central banks. At end-January 2010 swaps outstanding were $100 million with the Bank of Japan.

The United States has the right to purchase foreign currencies equivalent to its reserve position in the IMF automatically if needed. Under appropriate conditions, the United States could purchase additional amounts related to the U.S. quota.

Note.—Detail may not add to totals due to rounding.

Background

Data relating to U.S. international transactions in financial instruments and to other portfolio capital movements between the United States and foreign countries have been collected in some form since 1935. This information is necessary for compiling the U.S. balance of payments accounts, for calculating the U.S. international investment position, and for use in formulating U.S. international financial and monetary policies.

From the beginning, reporting under the Treasury data collection program has been mandatory. Under the current Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system, an assortment of monthly and quarterly reports are filed with district Federal Reserve banks by commercial banks, securities dealers, other financial institutions, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States. These data are centrally processed and maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which, along with the district banks, acts as fiscal agent for Treasury. Beginning in late 1998, the Federal Reserve Board also undertakes services on behalf of Treasury in support of the TIC data collection system. The TIC reports of individual respondents are treated as confidential, and access to the respondent level data is strictly limited to specific staff of Treasury and the Federal Reserve System.

Data derived from Treasury reports are published in the Capital Movements section of this quarterly Treasury Bulletin and are posted monthly on the TIC website, http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. (See NOTE at the end of the INTRODUCTION text for additional website information.)TIC data aggregates are also published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and are used in the U.S. international transactions and investment position compilations published by the Department of Commerce in the Survey of Current Business.

Forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultation with representatives of banks, securities firms, and nonbanking enterprises. Requests for public comments on proposed changes are published in the Federal Register, and any further modifications are based on the comments received. The most recent revisions to selected reporting forms and instructions were effective June 30, 2006. The reporting forms and instructions may be downloaded from the TIC website. Copies of the reporting forms and instructions also may be obtained from the Global Economics Group, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220; the International Finance Division, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551; or district Federal Reserve banks.

Basic definitions

The term "foreigner" as used in TIC reporting covers all institutions and individuals resident outside the United States, including: U.S. citizens domiciled abroad; the foreign branches, subsidiaries and offices of U.S. banks and business concerns; the central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of foreign countries, wherever located; and international and regional organizations, wherever located. The term "foreigner" also includes persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting on behalf of foreigners.

In general, information is reported opposite the country or geographical area where the foreigner is located, as shown on records of reporting institutions. This information may not always reflect the ultimate ownership of assets. Reporting institutions are not required to go beyond addresses shown on their records and may not be aware of the actual country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary.

Transactions with branches or agencies of foreign official institutions, wherever located, are reported opposite the country that has sovereignty over the institutions. Transactions with international and regional organizations are not reported opposite any single country, but are accounted for in regional groupings of such organizations. Effective beginning with data for June 2006, information pertaining to the Bank for International Settlements is now included with data for international organizations, and information for the European Central Bank is distributed across the individual euro-area countries. For prior dates, information for these organizations is included in "Other Europe".

"Short-term" refers to obligations payable on demand or having an original maturity of one year or less. "Long-term" refers to obligations having an original maturity of more than one year and includes securities having no maturity.

Reporting coverage

TIC reports are required from banks and other depository institutions, bank/financial holding companies (BHCs/FHCs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking concerns in the United States, including the branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and other affiliates in the United States of foreign banking and nonbanking firms. Institutions with total reportable liabilities, claims, or securities transactions below specified reporting thresholds are exempt from reporting.

Beginning in February 2003, substantial revisions to the coverage and formats of the TIC B-series and C-series forms were introduced. The reasons for the changes were to comply with new and expanded international standards for reporting data on portfolio investment; to reduce reporting burden; to clarify reporting concepts and instructions; and to improve the quality of the series by closing known gaps in the data.

Banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers file monthly B-series reports covering their dollar liabilities to and dollar claims on foreigners in a number of countries. Quarterly reports are filed for liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies and for claims on foreigners held for respondents' domestic customers. All positions are exclusive of long-term securities. Beginning January 2001, the exemption level applicable to the banking reports was raised from $15 million to $50 million. This exemption level is also subject to the provision that reportable amounts for any one country do not exceed $25 million.

Banks and other depository institutions, securities brokers and dealers, and other entities report their transactions with foreigners by country in long-term securities on monthly Form S. Respondents must report securities transactions with foreigners if their aggregate purchases or their aggregate sales amount to at least $50 million during the covered month.

TIC Form D is filed quarterly by all U.S. resident banks, securities dealers, and other firms with worldwide holding of derivatives in their own and in their customers' accounts exceeding $100 billion in notional value. Data from this information collection was first released on May 15, 2007, with data on holdings beginning from end-December 2005, and data on net settlements beginning from the first quarter of 2006.

Quarterly reports are also filed by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions, and securities firms), and other nonbanking enterprises on their liabilities and claims positions with unaffiliated foreigners. Separate reports are filed for financial balances and for commercial balances. Effective for reports filed as of March 31, 2003, the threshold applicable to Form CQ-1 for reporting financial liabilities to, and claims on, foreigners is $50 million, up from $10 million. At the same time, the reporting threshold for Form CQ-2, which covers commercial liabilities and claims positions with foreigners, was raised from $10 million to $25 million.

Effective with the reports filed for June 2006, the country coverage of the monthly TIC forms was expanded significantly and the semiannual reports, which covered the smaller market economies, were discontinued. Country coverage was also expanded for the quarterly banking forms, the Form S, the Form D, and the Forms CQ-1 and CQ-2, effective with reports filed for June 2006.

The data in these tables do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and other countries. Except as noted in Section IV in "Description of statistics" below, the principal exclusions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies (own foreign offices) and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international

capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce in its regular reports on the U.S. balance of payments.

Effective with the December 2009 Treasury Bulletin, a number of data reporters were reclassified in the TIC system as bank holding companies, beginning with the reports as of the fourth quarter of 2008. These data reporters are now included in the monthly bank-reported statistics and are no longer reporting as nonbanks.

Description of statistics

Data collected on the TIC forms are published in the "Capital Movements" tables in four sections. Each section contains all the data relevant to the same statistical series, with tables showing time series by type and country, and detailed breakdowns of the latest available data. The expansion of the country coverage on the standard report forms allows for publication of additional country detail for data beginning as of June 2006. As a result, the former Capital Movements Section III, which listed bank-reported claims and liabilities of selected countries from the semiannual reports, has been discontinued.

Section I covers liabilities to foreigners reported by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. BHCs/FHCs also report for all domestic nonbank, non-securities firm affiliates, other than their insurance affiliates, which report separately on the C-series forms. Dollar-denominated liabilities are reported monthly on Forms BL-1 and BL-2. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported quarterly on Form BQ-2. Respondents report certain of their own liabilities and a wide range of their custody liabilities to foreigners. Effective with reports filed as of February 28, 2003, coverage was broadened to cover the positions of U.S. broker-dealer respondents with their affiliated foreign offices. (Depository institutions and BHCs/FHCs already reported such positions.) The scope of the reports was also extended to include cross-border brokerage balances as well as offshore sweep accounts and loans to U.S. residents in “managed” foreign offices of U.S. reporting institutions. Additionally, in a new Part 2, Form BQ-2 was expanded to include the foreign currency-denominated liabilities held by respondents for their domestic customers. Further, banks’ own positions have been defined to be consistent with regulatory reports such as the FR 2950/2951 to include all amounts in the respondent’s “due to/due from” accounts, unless in an instrument that is specifically excluded. Finally, the columns for demand deposits and non-transactions accounts are now combined, as are short-term U.S. agency securities and other negotiable and readily transferable instruments.

Section II presents claims on foreigners reported by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. BHCs/FHCs also report for their domestic nonbank and non-securities firm affiliates, other than their insurance affiliates, which report

separately on the C-series forms. Data on respondents' own dollar claims are collected monthly on Form BC. Information on claims held for domestic customers as well as on claims denominated in foreign currencies is collected on a quarterly basis only on Forms BQ-1 and BQ-2, respectively. Effective with reports filed as of February 28, 2003, reporting coverage was expanded as outlined in Section I. Additionally, columns were added for separate reporting of issued by foreigners. Further, the foreigner category, negotiable CDs and other short-term negotiable instruments issued by foreigners. Further, the foreigner category, "foreign official institutions," replaced the former, broader category, "foreign public borrowers," for consistency with the liabilities reporting on this sector.

Section III (formerly reported as Section IV) shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners of exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers), and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Data exclude claims on foreigners held by banks in the United States.

Historically, the TIC reports CQ-1 and CQ-2 exclude accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. Such accounts with foreign affiliates are reported by business enterprises to Commerce on its direct investment forms. There was an exception when reporting of foreign affiliate positions of insurance underwriting subsidiaries and financial intermediaries was included in Section B of Form CQ-1 for reports between end-March 2003 and end-March 2006. That reporting requirement was discontinued with the reports beginning as of June 2006.

Section IV (formerly Section V) contains information on transactions with foreigners in long-term domestic and foreign securities as reported by banks, securities brokers and dealers, and other entities in the United States. The data cover transactions executed in the United States for the accounts of foreigners and transactions executed abroad for the accounts of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. This includes transactions in newly-issued securities as well as transactions in, and redemptions of, outstanding issues. However, the data do not include nonmarketable Treasury bonds and notes shown in Table IFS-3.

The geographical allocation of the transactions data indicates the country of location of the foreign buyers and sellers who deal directly with reporting institutions in the United States. The data do not necessarily indicate the country of beneficial owner or issuer, or the currency of denomination of securities. For instance, a U.S. purchaser's order for Japanese securities may be placed directly with an intermediary in London. In this instance, the transaction for Form S reporting purposes would be recorded opposite the

United Kingdom and not opposite Japan. Similarly, purchases and sales of U.S. securities for the account of an Italian resident may be placed, for example, in the Swiss market. In that case, the trades would be reported opposite Switzerland and not opposite Italy.

Section V presents quarterly data on holdings and net cash settlements of cross-border derivatives contracts reported by banks, securities brokers, dealers, and nonfinancial companies in the U.S. with sizable holdings of derivatives contracts. Total holdings are divided between those contracts with positive fair values and those contracts with negative fair values from the perspective of the reporter. The fair (market) value is generally defined as the amount for which a derivative contract could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The data on U.S. net settlements with foreign residents include all cash receipts and payments made during the quarter for the acquisition, sale, or final closeout of derivatives, including all settlement payments under the terms of derivatives contracts such as the periodic settlement under a swap agreement and the daily settlement of an exchange-traded contract. In calculating net settlements, U.S. receipts of cash from foreign persons are positive amounts (+), and U.S. payments of cash to foreign persons are negative amounts (-). Items excluded from net settlements are: (a) collateral including initial and maintenance margins, whether or not in the form of cash; and (b) purchases of underlying commodities, securities, or other noncash assets. (e.g., the purchase/sale by foreigners of a long-term security is reported on TIC Form S).

The gross fair (market) values and net settlement payments on derivatives are reported by type of derivative and by country based on the residence of the direct foreign counterparty. Positions of foreign customers on U.S. exchanges are reported opposite the country in which the foreign counterparty resides. In the case of U.S. residents' futures contracts on foreign exchanges, the country of the exchange is reported as the country of the foreign counterparty.

NOTE: Current and historical data on United States transactions with foreigners in long-term securities on the gross foreign liabilities and claims reported by banks and nonbanks in the United States and on derivatives contracts with foreigners are available on the TIC website: http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. These data may be downloaded as separate time series for each country or geographical area regularly shown in the capital movements tables. Also available on this website are other series, including a table on "Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities," showing estimated total holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes for current and recent periods. All data series on the TIC website are updated monthly.

CHART CM-A.—U.S. Liabilities to Foreigners

Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers, and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

U.S. liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks were recorded at $4.4 trillion in December 2009, a decrease of $357 billion from yearend 2008. U.S. banking liabilities include foreign holdings of U.S. short-term securities but exclude foreign holdings of U.S. long-term securities. U.S. banking liabilities increased about $93 billion in 2008. However, that increase is primarily attributable to the addition of several new bank holding companies to the reporter panel. U.S. banking liabilities increased about $696 billion in 2007 and about $824 billion in 2006. However, much of the increase in liabilities to foreigners in 2006 reflects changes in coverage in the bank-reported data in the first and second quarters of 2006. Between June and December of 2006, when data were reported on a consistent basis, banking liabilities increased about $250 billion.

U.S. banking liabilities are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that almost 60 percent of U.S. banking liabilities is currently recorded against the United Kingdom and banking centers in the Caribbean. These financial centers recorded most of the growth in banking liabilities in the years just before the financial crisis and also most of the decline since 2007. The United Kingdom, in particular, saw a sharp fall in recorded banking liabilities in 2008. However, the crisis affected other areas as well; U.S. banking liabilities to all other Europe and Asia, including Japan, also declined during 2009.

CHART CM-B.—U.S. Claims on Foreigners Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers, and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

In September 2009, U.S. claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks amounted to about $4 trillion, an increase of $365 billion from that recorded at yearend 2008. U.S. banking claims include holdings of foreign short-term securities but exclude holdings of foreign long-term securities. U.S. banking claims decreased $202 billion in 2008, but increased $671 billion in 2007 and $640 billion in 2006. Part of the 2006 increase reflects changes in coverage in the bank-reported data in the first and second quarters of 2006. Between June and December of 2006, when data were reported on a consistent basis, banking claims increased about $209 billion.

As with U.S. banking liabilities, U.S. banking claims on foreigners are concentrated in international financial centers. More than 60 percent of these claims are reported opposite the United Kingdom and banking centers in the Caribbean. These financial centers recorded much of the growth in U.S. banking claims since 2007. However, claims against Japan also grew rapidly in 2009, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the overall increase in U.S. banking claims on foreigners. Despite the turmoil in financial markets over the past two years, the geographic distribution of U.S. banking claims on foreigners is similar now to that of 2006.

CHART CM-C.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Domestic Securities by Foreigners, Selected Countries

The data on this page represent foreign investors' purchases and sales of long-term U.S. securities (that is, U.S. Treasury and Government agency bonds and notes, and U.S. corporate bonds and stocks) as reported in the TIC reporting system. Foreign investors have also acquired U.S. equities through mergers and reincorporations that involve stock swaps, but these acquisitions have been relatively small recently, totaling only $4 billion in 2006 and $11 billion in 2007. There were no reported acquisitions through stock swaps in 2008. Acquisitions totaled less than $1 billion in 2009. (Stock swaps data for the most recent quarter are Federal Reserve Board/Treasury estimates and are subject to substantial revisions.) These stock swaps were not reported under the TIC reporting system, but are available on the TIC Website. The TIC Website also provides estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on principal repayment flows of foreign holdings of U.S. government agency and corporate asset-backed securities (ABS). These repayments are estimated to have reduced foreign net purchases of U.S. securities by $160 billion in 2006, $234 billion in 2007, $191 billion in 2008, and $198 billion 2009.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

The "Treasury Bulletin" reports foreign currency holdings of large foreign exchange market participants. These reports provide information on positions in derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange futures and options, that are increasingly used in establishing foreign exchange positions but were not covered in the old reports.

The information is based on reports of large foreign exchange market participants on holdings of five major foreign currencies (Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound sterling, and euro) and the U.S. dollar. Positions in the U.S. dollar, which have been collected since January 1999, are intended to approximate "all other" currency positions of reporting institutions. U.S.-based businesses file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, branches, and agencies. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Filing is required by law (31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Regulations 128, Subpart C).

Weekly and monthly reports must be filed throughout the calendar year by major foreign exchange market participants, which are defined as market participants with more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (end March, June, September, or December). Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold.

A quarterly report must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange market participant that had more than $5 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any quarter the previous year (end March, June, September, or December).

This information is published in six sections corresponding to each of the major currencies covered by the reports. Tables I-1 through VI-1 present the currency data reported weekly by major market participants. Tables I-2 through VI-2 present more detailed currency data of major market participants, based on monthly Treasury reports. Tables I-3 through VI-3 present quarterly consolidated currency data reported by large market participants that do not file weekly reports.

Principal exchanged under cross-currency interest rate swaps is reported as part of purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Such principal also was noted separately on monthly and quarterly reports through December 1998, when this practice was discontinued. The net options position, or the net delta-equivalent value of an options position, is an estimate of the relationship between an option's value and an equivalent currency hedge. The delta equivalent value is defined as the product of the first partial derivative of an option valuation formula (with respect to the price of the underlying currency) multiplied by the notional principal of the contract.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established pursuant to chapter 6, section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (codified at 31 United States Code 5302), which authorized establishment of a Treasury fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose somewhat to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Resources of the fund include dollar balances, partially invested in U.S. Government securities, special drawing rights (SDRs), and balances of foreign currencies. Principal sources of income (+) or loss (-) for the fund are profits (+) or losses (-) on SDRs and foreign exchange, as well as interest earned on assets.

Table ESF-1 presents the assets, liabilities, and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents based on current exchange rates computed according to the accrual method of accounting. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the International Monetary Fund. Gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income (+) or loss (-) account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations by quarter. Figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents computed according to the accrual method. "Profit (+) or loss (-) on foreign exchange" includes realized profits or losses. "Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations" reflects net gain or loss on revaluation of SDR holdings and allocations for the quarter.

Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund adopted a technique for valuing the SDRs based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and allocations are valued on this basis beginning July 1974.

Note.— Annual balance sheets for fiscal years 1934 through 1940 appeared in the 1940 "Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury" and those for succeeding years appeared in subsequent reports through 1980. Quarterly balance sheets beginning with December 31, 1938, have been published in the "Treasury Bulletin." Data from inception to September 30, 1978, may be found on the statements published in the January 1979 "Treasury Bulletin."

INTRODUCTION: Financial Report of the United States Government

The following pages are excerpted from the 2008 Financial Report of the United States Government (Financial Report). The report and accompanying information, prepared and published annually by the Financial Management Service, are modeled after corporate-type reports and are developed on an accrual basis of accounting.

The excerpts represent some of the most noteworthy information contained in the Financial Report. Data for the Financial Report are compiled from Federal program agency

accounting systems Governmentwide. Treasury also presents a management discussion and analysis, the customary notes to the financial statements, a section on stewardship information, and supplemental information in the complete document.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required by law to audit the Financial Report. GAO's report, as well as the complete Financial Report, can be accessed easily through the internet at www.fms.treas.gov/fr.

FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, EXCERPT

Financial Statements of the United States Government for the Years Ended September 30, 2009, and September 30, 2008

Statements of Net Cost

These statements present the net cost of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 Government operations, including the operations related to earmarked funds (funds financed by specifically identified revenues, often supplemented by other financing sources, which remain available over time). The Government's fiscal year begins October 1 and ends September 30. Costs and earned revenues are categorized on the Statement of Net Cost by significant entity, providing greater accountability by showing the relationship of the agencies' net cost to the Governmentwide net cost. Costs and earned revenues are presented in this report by department on an accrual basis, while the budget presents costs and revenues by obligations and receipts, generally on a cash basis. The focus of the budget of the United States is by agency. Budgets are prepared, defended, and monitored by agency. In reporting by agency, we are assisting the external users in assessing the budget integrity, operating performance, stewardship, and systems and controls of the Government.

These statements contain the following three components:

Gross cost—is the full cost of all the departments and entities. These costs are assigned on a cause-and-effect basis, or reasonably allocated to the corresponding departments and entities.

Earned revenue—is exchange revenue resulting from the Government providing goods and services to the public at a price.

Net cost—is computed by subtracting earned revenue from gross cost.

Net cost for Governmentwide reporting purposes includes the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) agency allocations, and is net of intragovernmental eliminations. For this reason, individual agency net cost amounts will not agree with the agency's financial statements. Because of their specific functions, most of the costs originally associated with GSA and OPM have been allocated to their user agencies for Governmentwide reporting purposes. The remaining costs for GSA and OPM on the Statements of Net Cost are the administrative operating costs, the expenses from prior and past costs from health and pension plan amendments, and the actuarial gains and losses for these agencies. The interest on securities issued by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and held by the public is reported on Treasury's financial statements, but because of its importance, and the dollar amounts involved, it is reported separately in these statements.

Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Position

These statements report the results of Government operations which include the results of earmarked fund operations. They include non-exchange revenues that are generated principally by the Government's sovereign power to tax, levy duties, and assess fines and penalties. These statements also present the cost of Government operations, net of revenue earned from the sale of goods and services to the public (exchange revenue). They further include certain adjustments and unreconciled transactions that affect the net position.

1 For purposes of this document, "Government" refers to the United States Government.

Revenue

Individual income tax and tax withholdings include Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)/Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) taxes and other taxes. These taxes are characterized as non-exchange revenue.

Excise taxes consist of taxes collected for various items, such as airline tickets, gasoline products, distilled spirits and imported liquor, tobacco, firearms, and others. These are also characterized as non-exchange revenue. Miscellaneous earned revenues consist of earned revenues received from the public with virtually no associated cost. Therefore, unlike other earned revenues on the Statement of Net Cost, miscellaneous earned revenues are not subtracted from gross cost to derive net cost. It includes rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf Lands resulting from the leasing and development of mineral resources on public lands.

Earmarked revenues are required by statute to be used for designated activities, benefits or purposes and must be accounted for separately from the rest of the Government’s non-earmarked revenues. See Note 24—Earmarked Funds for detailed information.

Intragovernmental interest represents interest earned from the investment of surplus earmarked revenues, which finance the deficit spending of non-earmarked operations. These investments are recorded as intragovernmental debt holdings and are included in Note 14—Federal Debt Securities, in the table titled Intragovernmental Debt Holdings: Federal Debt Securities Held as Investments by Government Accounts. These interest payments and the associated investments are eliminated in the consolidation process.

Net Cost of Government Operations

The net cost of Government operations (which is gross cost less earned revenue) flows through from the Statements of Net Cost. The net cost associated with earmarked activities is separately reported.

Intragovernmental Transfers

Intragovernmental transfers reflect amounts required by statute to be transferred from the General Fund of the Treasury to earmarked funds (an example is the annual transfer to the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare Parts B and D) which receives sufficient funding from the General Fund to equal the annual costs incurred by these Medicare programs). Additionally, this line item includes contributions to earmarked funds made by Federal agencies on behalf of their employees, beneficiaries, or others.

Unmatched Transactions and Balances

Unmatched transactions and balances are adjustments needed to bring the change in net position into balance due to unreconciled intragovernmental differences, agency reporting errors, timing differences, and General Fund transactions in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and the Supplemental Information—Unmatched Transactions and Balances for detailed information.

Net Position, Beginning of Period

The net position, beginning of period, reflects the net position reported on the prior year’s balance sheet as of the end of that fiscal year. The net position for earmarked funds is shown separately.

Prior period adjustments are revisions to adjust the beginning net position and balances presented on the prior year financial statements due to corrections of errors or changes in accounting principles. See Note 1B—Basis of Accounting and Revenue Recognition, and Note 21—Prior Period Adjustments for detailed information.

Net Position, End of Period

The net position, end of period, amount reflects the net position as of the end of the fiscal year. The net position for earmarked funds is separately shown.

Reconciliations of Net Operating Cost and Unified Budget Deficit

These statements reconcile the results of operations (net operating cost) on the Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Position to the unified budget deficit in the President’s budget. The premise of the reconciliation is that the accrual and budgetary accounting bases share transaction data.

Receipts and outlays in the President's budget are measured primarily on a cash basis and differ from the accrual basis of accounting used in the Financial Report. These statements begin with the net results of operations (net operating cost), where operating revenues are reported on a modified cash basis of accounting and the net cost of Government operations on an accrual basis of accounting and reports activities where the bases of accounting for the components of net operating cost and the unified budget deficit differed.

Components of Net Operating Cost Not Part of the Budget Deficit

This information includes the operating components, such as the changes in benefits payable for veterans, military and civilian employees, the environmental liabilities, and depreciation expense not included in the budget results.

Components of the Budget Deficit Not Part of Net Operating Cost

This information includes the budget components, such as capitalized fixed assets, changes in net inventory, and increases in other assets not included in the operating results. These items impact the balance sheet only and are not part of the operating results.

Statements of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities

The primary purpose of these statements is to report how the annual unified budget deficit relates to the change in the Government's cash and other monetary assets and debt held by the public. It explains why the unified budget deficit normally would not result in an equivalent change in the Government's cash and other monetary assets.

These statements reconcile the unified budget deficit to the change in cash and other monetary assets during the fiscal year and explain how the budget deficits (fiscal years 2009 and 2008) were financed. A budget deficit is the result of outlays (expenditures) exceeding receipts (revenue) during a particular fiscal year.

The budget deficit is typically financed through borrowings from the public. Other transactions also require cash disbursements and are not part of the repayments of the debt. These other transactions, such as the payment of interest on debt held by the public, contributed to the use of cash. The budget deficit also includes certain amounts that are accrued and will be disbursed in a future period or are adjustments that did not affect the cash balance. These amounts include interest accrued on debt issued by Treasury and held by the public and subsidy expense related to direct and guaranteed loan as well as equity investment activity and did not contribute to the change in the cash balance.

These statements show the adjustments for noncash outlays included in the budget and items affecting the cash balance not included in the budget to explain the change in cash and other monetary assets.

Balance Sheets

The balance sheets show the Government's assets, liabilities, and net position. When combined with stewardship information, this information presents a more comprehensive understanding of the Government's financial position. The net position for earmarked funds is shown separately.

Assets

Assets included on the balance sheets are resources of the Government that remain available to meet future needs. The most significant assets that are reported on the balance sheets are property, plant, and equipment; cash and other monetary assets; inventories; loans receivable and mortgage backed securities, net; and Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Direct Loans and Equity Investments, net. There are, however, other significant resources available to the Government that extend beyond the assets presented in these financial statements. Those resources include stewardship assets, including natural resources, and the Government's sovereign powers to tax, regulate commerce, set monetary policy, and the power to print additional currency.

Liabilities and Net Position

Liabilities are obligations of the Government resulting from prior actions that will require financial resources. The most significant liabilities reported on the balance sheets are Federal debt securities held by the public and accrued interest and Federal employee and veteran benefits payable. Liabilities also include environmental and disposal liabilities and social insurance benefits due and payable as of the reporting date.

As with reported assets, the Government's responsibilities, policy commitments, and contingencies are much broader than these reported balance sheet liabilities. They include the social insurance programs in the Statements of Social Insurance and are disclosed in the Supplemental Information—Social Insurance section and a wide range of other programs under which the Government provides benefits and services to the people of this Nation, as well as certain future loss contingencies.

March 2010

FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, EXCERPT

The Government has entered into contractual commitments requiring the future use of financial resources and has unresolved contingencies where existing conditions, situations, or circumstances create uncertainty about future losses. Commitments, as well as contingencies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as liabilities on the balance sheets, but for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that losses have been incurred, are disclosed in Note 22—Contingencies and Note 23—Commitments.

The collection of earmarked taxes and other earmarked revenue is credited to the corresponding Earmarked Fund that will use these funds to meet a particular Government purpose. If the collections from taxes and other sources exceed the payments to the beneficiaries, the excess revenue is invested in Treasury securities or "loaned" to Treasury's General Fund; therefore, the trust fund balances do not represent cash. An explanation of the trust funds for social insurance and many of the other large trust funds is included in Note 24—Earmarked Funds. That note also contains information about trust fund receipts, disbursements, and assets.

Because of its sovereign power to tax and borrow, and the country's wide economic base, the Government has unique access to financial resources through generating tax revenues and issuing Federal debt securities. This provides the Government with the ability to meet present obligations and those that are anticipated from future operations and are not reflected in net position.

Statements of Social Insurance

The Statements of Social Insurance provide estimates of the status of the most significant social insurance programs: Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung social insurance programs, which are administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), HHS, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), and the Department of Labor (DOL), respectively. The estimates are actuarial present values2 of the projections and are based on the economic and demographic assumptions representing the trustees’ best estimates as set forth in the relevant Social Security and Medicare trustees’ reports and in the relevant agency performance and accountability reports for the RRB and the DOL (Black Lung).

The magnitude and complexity of social insurance programs, coupled with the extreme sensitivity of projections relating to the many assumptions of the programs, produce a wide range of possible results. In preparing the Statements of Social Insurance, Government management considers and selects assumptions and data that it believes provide a reasonable basis for the assertions in the statement. However, because of the large number of factors that affect the Statements of Social Insurance and the fact that such assumptions are inherently subject to substantial uncertainly (arising from the likelihood of future events, significant uncertainties, and contingencies), there will be differences between the estimates in the Statements of Social Insurance and the actual results, and those differences may be material. Note 26—Social Insurance describes the social insurance programs, reports long-range estimates that can be used to assess the financial condition of the programs, and explains some of the factors that impact the various programs. Using this information, readers can apply their own judgment as to the condition and sustainability of the individual programs.

2 Present values recognize that a dollar paid or collected in the future is worth less than a dollar today, because a dollar today could be invested and earn interest. To calculate a present value, future amounts are thus reduced using an assumed interest rate, and those reduced amounts are summed.

INTRODUCTION: Airport and Airway Trust Fund

The Airport and Airway Trust Fund was established on the books of Treasury in fiscal year 1971, according to provisions of the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 [49 United States Code 1742(a), repealed]. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-248, dated September 3, 1982) reestablished the trust fund in the Internal Revenue Code (26 United States Code 9502) effective September 1, 1982.

Treasury transfers from the general fund to the trust fund amounts equivalent to the taxes received from transportation of persons and property by air, gasoline and jet fuel used in commercial and noncommercial aircraft, and an international arrival and departure tax. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508, dated November 5, 1990) increased rates for the excise taxes transferred to the fund.

Treasury bases these transfers on estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury. These are subject to adjustments in later transfers in the amount of actual tax receipts.

The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-34), effective October 1, 1997, extended the aviation excise taxes for 10 years, until September 30, 2007. The Act included other provisions that:

Converted the 10 percent ad valorem tax on domestic passenger tickets to a combination of ad valorem/flight segment tax over 3 years, beginning October 1, 1997. The tax is 7.5 percent, plus in calendar year 2009, a $3.60 tax per segment.

Retained the existing freight waybill and general aviation jet fuel/gas taxes. It also retained a special rule applied to flights between the continental United States and Alaska or Hawaii. The $6 departure tax is indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Effective calendar year 2009, the tax is $8.00.

Imposed a new 7.5 percent tax on payments to airlines for frequent flyer and similar awards by banks and credit card companies, merchants and frequent flyer program partners, such as other airlines, hotels and rental car companies, and other businesses.

Increased the $6 international departure tax to $12 per passenger and added a $12 international arrival tax,

indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Effective 2009, the tax is $16.10.

Lowered ticket tax rates on flights to certain rural airports to 7.5 percent without a flight segment tax component.

Transferred revenues from the 4.3 cents-per-gallon aviation fuel tax previously dedicated to reducing the national deficit from the general fund to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.

The aviation excise taxes were extended as part of a series of continuing resolutions (Public Laws 110-92, 110-116, 110-137, and 110-149), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161), the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-190), the Federal Aviator Administration Extension Act, 2008 (Public Laws 110-252 and 110-330), the Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act 2009 (Public Law 111-12), and the Fiscal Year 2010 Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act (Public Laws 111-69 and 111-16). As of January 20, 2010, the majority of the taxes (with the exception of the 4.3 cents per gallon component of the fuel taxes) are scheduled to expire on March 31, 2010.

When the provisions of 26 United States Code 9602(b) are met, amounts available in the trust fund exceed outlay requirements, Treasury invests excess amounts in public debt securities and credits the interest to the fund. Additional sums from the general fund also are credited as authorized and made available, by law, if they are needed to meet outlay requirements.

Treasury makes available to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation (DOT), amounts required for outlays to carry out the Airport and Airway program. The Secretary of the Treasury makes other charges to the trust fund to transfer certain refunds of taxes and certain outfits, under section 34 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

Annual reports to Congress, required by 26 U.S.C. 9602 (a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the trust fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Fund

The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1993, according to provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 United States Code 2297g). Receipts represent (1) fees collected from domestic public utilities based on their pro rata share of purchases of separative work units from the Department of Energy (DOE) and (2) appropriations toward the Government contribution based on the balance of separative work unit purchases.

Expenditures from the fund are for the purpose of (1) decontamination and decommissioning of the three gaseous diffusion plants, (2) remedial actions and related environmental restoration costs at the gaseous diffusion plants, and (3) reimbursement to uranium/thorium producers for the costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and remedial action of uranium/thorium sites that are incident to sales to the U.S. Government.

Amounts available in the fund exceeding current needs may be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of the United States (1) having maturities congruent with the needs of the fund and (2) bearing interest at rates determined appropriate, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to these investments.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required by 42 United States Code 2297g(b)(1) to provide an annual report to Congress, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy. This report must present the financial condition and the results of operations of the fund during the preceding fiscal year.

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 United States Code 2297g-1, as amended) authorizes funding to ensure annual deposits to the fund of $518.2 million before adjustments for inflation. The Act stipulates that the Government deposit $396.6 million, adjusted for inflation, annually. The Act also calls for deposits of $150 million from domestic public utility assessments. The assessments were authorized for 15 years with the final assessment scheduled for fiscal year 2007. Between fiscal years 1993 and 2007, the total Government contribution amount authorized by the Act was $6,281.0 million. During that time span, the Government contributed only $5,362.4 million to the fund. The resulting shortfall in authorized Government contributions was, therefore, $918.6 million. The Government has continued to make annual contributions to eliminate this shortfall. Through fiscal year 2009 contributions, the overall shortfall (after adjustments for inflation) is $40.6 million.

INTRODUCTION: Black Lung Disability Trust Fund

The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1978 according to the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-227). The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-119) reestablished the fund in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 United States Code 9501.

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272), enacted April 7, 1986, provided for an increase in the coal tax rates effective April 1, 1986, through December 31, 1995, and a 5-year forgiveness of interest retroactive to October 1, 1985. The 5-year moratorium on interest payments ended on September 30, 1990. Payment of interest on advances resumed in fiscal year 1991. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-203, title X, section 10503), signed December 22, 1987, extended the temporary increase in the coal tax through December 31, 2013.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343, title I, subtitle B, section 113), enacted October 3, 2008, restructured the Trust Fund Debt by 1) refinancing the outstanding principal of the repayable advances and unpaid interest on such advances and 2) providing a one time Appropriation to the Trust Fund in an amount sufficient to pay to the general fund of the Treasury the difference between the market value of the outstanding repayable advances, plus accrued interest and the proceeds from the obligations issued by the Trust Fund to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Act also extends the temporary increase in the coal tax through December 31, 2018, and allows the prepayment of the Trust Fund debt prior to the maturity date.

The Code designates the following receipts to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund: excise taxes on coal sold; taxable expenditures of self-dealing by, and excess contributions to, private black lung benefit trusts; reimbursements by responsible mine operators; and related fines, penalties and interest charges.

Estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury determine monthly transfers of amounts for excise taxes to the trust fund subject to adjustments in later transfers to actual tax receipts.

After retirement of the current indebtedness, amounts available in the fund exceeding current expenditure requirements will be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing public debt securities. Any interest earned will be credited to the fund. Also credited, if necessary, will be repayable advances from the general fund to meet outlay requirements exceeding available revenues.

To carry out the program, amounts are made available to the Department of Labor (DOL). Also charged to the fund are administrative expenses incurred by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Treasury, repayments of advances from the general fund and interest on advances.

The Code requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual report to Congress after consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of HHS [26 United States Code 9602(a)]. The report must present the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and the expected condition and operations of the fund during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund

The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury on April 1, 1987, according to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662, November 17, 1986) (26 United States Code 9505).

Amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are available as provided by appropriation acts for making expenditures to carry out section 210(a) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. The appropriations act for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for fiscal year 1995 (Public Law 103-331, September 28, 1994), section 339, waived collection of charges or tolls on the Saint Lawrence Seaway in accordance with section 13(b) of the Act of May 13, 1954 (as in effect on April 1, 1987). Legislation was passed in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182, section 683), which amends paragraph (3) of section 9505(c) of the IRC of 1986, to authorize payment of up to $5 million annually to Treasury for all expenses of administration incurred by the Treasury, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Commerce (Commerce) related to the administration of subchapter A of chapter 36 (relating to harbor maintenance tax). Section 201 of the Water

Resources Development Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-303) authorizes use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for construction of dredged material disposal facilities associated with the operation and maintenance of Federal navigation projects for commercial navigation.

A summary judgment issued October 25, 1995, by the United States Court of International Trade in the case United States Shoe Corp. v. United States (Court No. 94-11-00668) found the Harbor Maintenance fee unconstitutional under the Export Clause of the Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 5) and enjoined the Customs Service from collecting the fee.

The decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court on March 31, 1998 (118 Supreme Court 1290). With the tax on exports no longer collected, revenues have been reduced by approximately 30 percent.

The Code requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual report to Congress [26 United States Code 9602(a)]. The report must present the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and the expected condition and operations of the fund during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Hazardous Substance Superfund

The Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1981, in accordance with section 221 of the Hazardous Substance Response Revenue Act of 1980 [42 United States Code 9631(a), repealed]. The trust fund was renamed the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund) and relocated in accordance with section 517 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 [Public Law 99-499, dated October 17, 1986 (26 United States Code 9507)].

The authority to collect excise taxes on petroleum and chemicals, and an environmental tax for all corporations

with modified alternative taxable income in excess of $2 million, expired in 1995. To implement the Superfund program, amounts are appropriated from the Superfund to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for programmatic and administrative expenses.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of Treasury is required by 26 United States Code 9602(a). These reports present the financial condition of the Superfund and the results of operation for the past fiscal year, and its expected condition during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Highway Trust Fund

The Highway Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1957, according to provisions of the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (Act of June 29, 1956, chapter 462, section 209). It has been amended and extended by various highway surface transportation and other acts since 1959. Section 1110(d) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy For Users (SAFETEA-LU) (Public Law 109-59) extended the Highway Trust Fund to be available for making expenditures before September 30, 2009 (October 1, 2009, in the case of expenditures for administrative expenses).

Amounts equivalent to taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuels, certain tires, heavy trucks and trailers, and heavy vehicle use are designated by the Act to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund. These transfers are made twice monthly based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to later adjustments to reflect the amount of actual tax receipts. Amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in non-interest-bearing public debt securities.

Within the fund is a mass transit account, funded by a portion of the excise tax collections under sections 4041 and 4081 of the IRC (title 26 United States Code). The funds from this account are used for expenditures in accordance with chapter 53 of title 49 United States Code, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), and SAFETEA-LU. The remaining excise taxes are included in a separate account within the

trust fund commonly referred to as the highway account. Expenditures from this account are made according to the provisions of various transportation acts.

Amounts required for outlays to carry out the eligible surface transportation programs are made available to the responsible operating administrations within the Department of Transportation. Other charges to the trust fund are made by the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer of certain taxes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, is required to submit annual reports to Congress by section 9602(a) of title 26 United States Code. These reports cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund for the past fiscal year and expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is required by 26 U.S.C. 9503(d)(7) to report to specified Congressional Committees any estimate which he, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, makes pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9503(d)(1) or any determination which he makes pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9503(d)(2). The Congressional Committees are the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committees on the Budget of both Houses, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.

INTRODUCTION: Inland Waterways Trust Fund

The Inland Waterways Trust Fund was established by the Treasury in fiscal year 1984, pursuant to section 203 of the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-502) and continued pursuant to section 1405 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662, codified at 26 United States Code 9506). Under 26 United States Code 9506(b), amounts from taxes on fuel used in commercial transportation on inland waterways, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, are appropriated to the trust fund.

The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-647, approved November 10, 1988), increased the tax each year, 1990 through 1995. These amounts are transferred quarterly from the general fund based on estimates made by the Secretary, subject to adjustments in later transfers to the amounts of actual tax receipts.

The Secretary of the Treasury invests in interest-bearing obligations of the United States that portion of the trust fund, in his judgment, not required to meet current withdrawals. The interest on, and proceeds from, the sale or redemption of any obligation held in the trust fund is credited to the trust fund. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-502) provides that amounts in the trust fund shall be available as provided, by appropriations acts, for construction and rehabilitation expenditures for navigation on the inland and intracoastal waterways of the United States described in 33 United States Code 1804. Expenditures must be otherwise authorized by law.

Annual reports to Congress are required by 26 United States Code 9602(a) to be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and the results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund

The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund was established in fiscal year 1981 according to provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-510, codified at 26 United States Code 9508), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Re-authorization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-499, dated October 17, 1986), sections 13163(c) and 13242(d)(42) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66, dated August 10, 1993), and section 1032(e)(13) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1987 (Public Law 105-34, dated August 5, 1997).

The LUST Trust Fund is financed by taxes collected on gasoline, diesel fuels, special motor fuels, aviation fuels and fuels used in commercial transportation on inland

waterways. Amounts available in the LUST Trust Fund, exceeding current expenditure requirements, are invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing Government securities (e.g., Treasury bills). All interest earned is credited directly to the LUST Trust Fund.

To carry out the LUST program, amounts are appropriated for the LUST Trust Fund to the EPA for programmatic and administrative expenses.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury is required by 26 United States Code 9602(a). These reports present the financial condition of the LUST Trust Fund and results of operations for the past fiscal year and its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Nuclear Waste Fund

The Nuclear Waste Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1983, according to section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 [Public Law 97-425, codified at 42 United States Code 10222(c)]. Receipts represent fees collected from public utilities based on electricity generated by nuclear power reactors and spent nuclear fuel. Expenditures from the fund are for purposes of radioactive waste disposal activities.

Amounts available in the fund exceeding current needs may be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of the United States (1) having maturities in tandem with the needs of the waste fund and (2) bearing interest at rates determined appropriate, taking into

consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the maturities of such investments, except that the interest rate on such investments shall not exceed the average interest rate applicable to existing borrowings.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE), is required by 42 United States Code 10222(e)(1). This report must present the financial condition and the results of operations of the waste fund during the preceding fiscal year.

INTRODUCTION: Reforestation Trust Fund

The Reforestation Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1981 to continue through September 30, 1985, according to provisions of Title III—Reforestation, of the Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Act of 1980 [Public Law 96-451, codified at 16 United States Code 1606a(a)].

The act provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to the trust fund tariffs, limited to not more than $30 million for any fiscal year, received in the Treasury from October 1, 1979, through September 30, 1985, on (1) rough and primary wood products and wood waste; (2) lumber, flooring and moldings; and (3) wood veneers, plywood, other wood-veneer assemblies and building boards. Public Law 99-190, title II, 99 Statutes at Large 1245, extended the receipts for the trust fund. Amounts available in the reforestation trust fund exceeding current withdrawals are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States

or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations are credited to the trust fund.

The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture is authorized to obligate available sums in the trust fund (including any amounts not obligated in previous years) for (1) reforestation and timber stand improvement and (2) administrative costs of the Government for these activities.

Annual reports are required by 16 United States Code 1606a(c) (1) to be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, on the financial condition and the results of the operations of the trust fund during the past fiscal year and on its expected condition and operations during the next fiscal year.

INTRODUCTION: Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund

The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund (ARTF) was established on the books of the Treasury pursuant to the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 [Public Law 98-369, division A, title X, section 1016(a), approved July 18, 1984]. The ARTF was restructured and renamed the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users or “SAFETEA-LU” [Public Law 109-59, title XI, subtitle B, part 2, section 11115, approved August 10, 2005,] as amended by the Sportfishing and Recreational Boating Safety Amendments Act of 2005 [Public Law 109-74, approved September 29, 2005]. P.L. 109-59 (The Transportation Equity Act) comprehensively amended and reauthorized the Sport Fish Restoration Program to (beginning in fiscal years 2006-2009) permanently appropriate boat safety funding and modify distribution of funds whereby all accounts will annually receive a fixed percentage of the total fund revenue, eliminated the ARTF to create a Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund, and modified the excise tax on certain sport fishing equipment. P.L. 109-59 expired September 30, 2009. Reauthorization is currently pending before Congress.

Effective October 1, 2005, motorboat fuel taxes (less $1 million transferred to the Land and Water Conservation Fund) and small engine gasoline taxes [pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Public Law

101-508, title XI, section 11211(i)(2) and (3)] were transferred from the Highway Trust Fund to the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund. In addition, amounts equivalent to the excise taxes received on sport fishing equipment and import duties on fishing tackle, yachts, and pleasure craft are appropriated into the fund.

Amounts in the trust fund are used, as provided by appropriation acts, for the purposes of carrying out the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act, approved August 9, 1950, the purposes of section 13106 of title 46, United States Code, the purpose of section 7404(d) of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, and the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (as amended by SAFETEA-LU).

When the provisions of 26 United States Code 9602(b) are met, amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in public debt securities with the interest credited to the fund.

Annual reports to Congress required by 26 United States Code 9602(a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund

The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury by section 8033 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-509). It was made effective on January 1, 1990, by section 7811(m)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-239) and amended by section 9001of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-380). The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343) increased the barrel tax on petroleum from five cents per barrel to eight cents from 2009 through 2016, and to nine cents in 2017. The act also repeals the requirement that the tax be suspended when the unobligated balance exceeds $2.7 billion.

Amounts equivalent to the taxes received from the environmental tax on petroleum, but only to the extent of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund rate, are appropriated to the fund.

Certain amounts were transferred from other funds and were appropriated to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund as

provided by 26 United States Code 9509(b). Certain paid penalties and amounts recovered for damages are also appropriated to the fund.

Amounts in the fund are available for oil spill cleanup costs and certain other related purposes as provided by appropriations acts or section 6002(b) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-380).

When the provisions of 26 United States Code 9602(b) are met, amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in public debt securities. Interest is credited to the fund.

Annual reports to Congress, required by 26 United States Code 9602(a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

The Trade Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-210, signed August 6, 2002) extended the sunset provision to January 1, 2006. The Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-429, signed December 3, 2004) extended the sunset provision to 2008. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280, signed August 17, 2006) extended the sunset provision to 2010. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343, signed October 3, 2008) extended the sunset provision to 2015.

The Act provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to the trust fund out of the general fund of the U.S. Treasury amounts determined to be equivalent to the duty received on articles under chapters 51 and 52 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

Glossary

With References to Applicable Sections and Tables

Source: Financial Management Service

Amounts outstanding and in circulation (USCC)—Includes all issues by the Bureau of the Mint purposely intended as a medium of exchange. Coins sold by the Bureau of the Mint at premium prices are excluded; however, uncirculated coin sets sold at face value plus handling charge are included.

Average discount rate (PDO-1, -2)—In Treasury bill auctions, purchasers tender competitive bids on a discount rate basis. The average discount rate is the weighted, or adjusted, average of all bids accepted in the auction.

Budget authority (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Congress passes laws giving budget authority to Government entities, which gives the agencies the power to spend Federal funds. Congress can stipulate various criteria for the spending of these funds. For example, Congress can stipulate that a given agency must spend within a specific year, number of years, or any time in the future.

The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, authority to borrow, contract authority, and authority to obligate and expend offsetting receipts and collections. The period of time during which Congress makes funds available may be specified as 1-year, multiple-year, or no-year. The available amount may be classified as either definite or indefinite; a specific amount or an unspecified amount can be made available. Authority also may be classified as current or permanent. Permanent authority requires no current action by Congress.

Budget deficit—The total, cumulative amount by which budget outlays (spending) exceed budget receipts (income).

Cash management bills (PDO-1)—Marketable Treasury bills of irregular maturity lengths, sold periodically to fund short-term cash needs of Treasury. Their sale, having higher minimum and multiple purchase requirements than those of other issues, is generally restricted to competitive bidders.

Competitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—A bid to purchase a stated amount of one issue of Treasury securities at a specified yield or discount. The bid is accepted if it is within the range accepted in the auction. (See Noncompetitive tenders.)

Currency no longer issued (USCC)—Old and new series gold and silver certificates, Federal Reserve notes, national bank notes, and 1890 Series Treasury notes.

Debt outstanding subject to limitation (FD-6)—The debt incurred by the Treasury subject to the statutory limit set by Congress. Until World War I, a specific amount of debt was authorized to each separate security issue. Beginning with the

Second Liberty Loan Act of 1917, the nature of the limitation was modified until, in 1941, it developed into an overall limit on the outstanding Federal debt. As of December 2009, the debt limit was $12,394,000 million; the limit may change from year to year.

The debt subject to limitation includes most of Treasury's public debt except securities issued to the Federal Financing Bank, upon which there is a limitation of $15 billion, and certain categories of older debt (totaling approximately $595 million as of February 1991).

Discount—The interest deducted in advance when purchasing notes or bonds. (See Accrued discount.)

Discount rate (PDO-1)—The difference between par value and the actual purchase price paid, annualized over a 360-day year. Because this rate is less than the actual yield (coupon-equivalent rate), the yield should be used in any comparison with coupon issue securities.

Dollar coins (USCC)—Include standard silver and nonsilver coins.

Domestic series (FD-2)—Nonmarketable, interest- and non-interest-bearing securities issued periodically by Treasury to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RFC) for investment of funds authorized under section 21B of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 United States Code 1441b).

Federal intrafund transactions (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Intrabudgetary transactions in which payments and receipts both occur within the same Federal fund group (Federal funds or trust funds).

Federal Reserve notes (USCC)—Issues by the U.S. Government to the public through the Federal Reserve banks and their member banks. They represent money owed by the Government to the public. Currently, the item “Federal Reserve notes—amounts outstanding” consists of new series issues. The Federal Reserve note is the only class of currency currently issued.

Foreign (“Foreign Currency Positions,” IFS-2, -3)—Locations other than those included under the definition of the United States. (See United States.)

Foreigner ("Capital Movements," IFS-2)—All institutions and individuals living outside the United States, including U.S. citizens living abroad, and branches, subsidiaries, and other affiliates abroad of U.S. banks and business concerns; central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of countries other than the United States; and

March 2010

GLOSSARY

international and regional organizations, wherever located. Also refers to persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting for foreigners.

Foreign official institutions ("Capital Movements")—Includes central governments of foreign countries, including all departments and agencies of national governments; central banks, exchange authorities, and all fiscal agents of foreign national governments that undertake activities similar to those of a treasury, central bank, or stabilization fund; diplomatic and consular establishments of foreign national governments; and any international or regional organization, including subordinate and affiliate agencies, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states.

Foreign public borrower ("Capital Movements")—Includes foreign official institutions, as defined above, the corporations and agencies of foreign central governments, including development banks and institutions, and other agencies that are majority-owned by the central government or its departments; and state provincial and local governments of foreign countries and their departments and agencies.

Foreign-targeted issue (PDO-2)—Foreign-targeted issues were notes sold between October 1984 and February 1986 to foreign institutions, foreign branches of U.S. institutions, foreign central banks or monetary authorities, or to international organizations in which the United States held membership. Sold as companion issues, they could be converted to domestic (normal) Treasury notes with the same maturity and interest rates. Interest was paid annually.

Fractional coins (USCC)—Coins minted in denominations of 50, 25, and 10 cents, and minor coins (5 cents and 1 cent).

Government account series (FD-2)—Certain trust fund statutes require the Secretary of the Treasury to apply monies held by these funds toward the issuance of nonmarketable special securities. These securities are sold directly by Treasury to a specific Government agency, trust fund, or account. Their rate is based on an average of market yields on outstanding Treasury obligations, and they may be redeemed at the option of the holder. Roughly 80 percent of these are issued to five holders: the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; the civil service retirement and disability fund; the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the military retirement fund; and the Unemployment Trust Fund.

Interfund transactions (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Transactions in which payments are made from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in another group.

International Monetary Fund ("Exchange Stabilization Fund," IFS-1)—(IMF) Established by the United Nations, the IMF promotes international trade, stability of exchange, and monetary cooperation. Members are allowed to draw from the fund.

Intrabudgetary transactions (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—These occur when payment and receipt both occur within the budget, or when payment is made from off-budget Federal entities whose budget authority and outlays are excluded from the budget totals.

Noncompetitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—This is a tender or bid to purchase a stated par amount of securities at the highest yield or discount rate awarded to competitive bidders for a single-price auction.

Obligations (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—An unpaid commitment to acquire goods or services.

Off-budget Federal entities ("Federal Fiscal Operations")— Federally owned and controlled entities whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals under provisions of law. Their receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit are not included in budget receipts, outlays, or deficits. Their budget authority is not included in totals of the budget.

Outlays (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Payments on obligations in the form of cash, checks, the issuance of bonds or notes, or the maturing of interest coupons.

Own foreign offices ("Capital Movements")—Refers to U.S. reporting institutions' parent organizations, branches and/or majority-owned subsidiaries located outside the United States.

Par value—The face value of bonds or notes, including interest.

Quarterly financing (“Treasury Financing Operations”)—Treasury has historically offered packages of several “coupon” security issues on the 15th of February, May, August, and November, or on the next working day. These issues currently consist of a 3-year note, a 10-year note, and a 30-year bond. Treasury sometimes offers additional amounts of outstanding long-term notes or bonds, rather than selling new security issues. (See Reopening.)

Receipts ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Funds collected from selling land, capital, or services, as well as collections from the public (budget receipts), such as taxes, fines, duties, and fees.

Reopening (PDO-2)—The offer for sale of additional amounts of outstanding issues, rather than an entirely new issue. A reopened issue will always have the same maturity date, CUSIP-number, and interest rate as the original issue.

Special drawing rights ("Exchange Stabilization Fund," IFS-1)—International assets created by IMF that serve to increase international liquidity and provide additional international reserves. SDRs may be purchased and sold among eligible holders through IMF. (See IMF.)

SDR allocations are the counterpart to SDRs issued by IMF based on members' quotas in IMF. Although shown in Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) statements as liabilities,

March 2010

GLOSSARY

they must be redeemed by ESF only in the event of liquidation of, or U.S. withdrawal from, the SDR department of IMF or cancellation of SDRs.

SDR certificates are issued to the Federal Reserve System against SDRs when SDRs are legalized as money. Proceeds of monetization are deposited into an ESF account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Spot (“Foreign Currency Positions”)—Due for receipt or delivery within 2 workdays.

State and local government series (SLGS) (FD-2)—Special nonmarketable certificates, notes, and bonds offered to State and local governments as a means to invest proceeds from their own tax-exempt financing. Interest rates and maturities comply with IRS arbitrage provisions. SLGS are offered in both time deposit and demand deposit forms. Time deposit certificates have maturities of up to 1 year. Notes mature in 1 to 10 years and bonds mature in more than 10 years. Demand deposit securities are 1-day certificates rolled over with a rate adjustment daily.

Statutory debt limit (FD-6)—By Act of Congress there is a limit, either temporary or permanent, on the amount of public debt that may be outstanding. When this limit is reached, Treasury may not sell new debt issues until Congress

increases or extends the limit. For a detailed listing of changes in the limit since 1941, see the Budget of the United States Government. (See debt outstanding subject to limitation.)

STRIPS (PDO-2)—Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Long-term notes and bonds may be divided into principal and interest-paying components, which may be transferred and sold in amounts as small as $1,000. STRIPS are sold at auction at a minimum par amount, varying for each issue. The amount is an arithmetic function of the issue's interest rate.

Treasury bills—The shortest term Federal security (maturity dates normally varying from 3 to 12 months), are sold at a discount.

Trust fund transaction (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—An intrabudgetary transaction in which both payments and receipts occur within the same trust fund group.
