Profile of the Economy

[Source: Office of Macroeconomic Analysis]

As of November 19, 2020

Introduction

The United States was in an historically strong economic position before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Real GDP rose 2.3 percent in 2019 on a Q4/Q4 basis and was poised to maintain a solid pace of growth in 2020 until the pandemic. In January and February, nonfarm payroll employment rose an average of 232,500 per month, the unemployment rate hovered near the five-decade low of 3.5 percent, and the labor force participation rate reached a six-year high of 63.4 percent.

In March, however, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in state and local governments implementing various restrictions to mitigate the pandemic's impact on health resources. These measures contributed to an historically sharp contraction: 22 million jobs were lost in March and April, and the unemployment rate peaked at 14.7 percent – a post-WWII high. Moreover, real GDP decreased 5.0 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2020, sharpening to 31.4 percent in the second quarter. Altogether, the U.S. economy contracted by nearly $2.0 trillion at an annual rate in the first half of the year.

The U.S. government responded quickly to the economic shock with unprecedentedly bold policy to support American households and small businesses during the pandemic. Just two weeks after the first stay-at-home orders were issued, Congress authorized three record-setting economic aid packages totaling roughly $2.7 trillion. The Administration rapidly implemented the various measures, including Economic Impact Payments, expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits, and the Paycheck Protection Program, which provided forgivable loans to small businesses to encourage employee retention. These policies temporarily boosted household savings, reduced unemployment, and allowed small businesses to resume operations when their local economies re-opened.

Due to the government's robust response and the relaxation of stay-at-home orders, the economy started to recover in May after just two months of contraction. By the end of October, 12.1 million jobs had been recovered and the unemployment rate had fallen by 7.8 percentage points to 6.9 percent. In addition, real GDP surged by 33.1 percent at an annual rate in 2020 Q3, or almost double the previous record pace set in 1950. Given this record-setting growth in Q3, the U.S. economy recovered in one quarter roughly 66 percent of the cumulative loss in the first half of 2020.

Growth of Real GDP

(Quarterly percent change at annual rate)

Economic Growth

The economy's rebound in the third quarter was substantial as well as historic: real GDP growth of 33.1 percent at an annual rate was the fastest quarterly pace in seventy years. This followed declines of 5.0 percent and 31.4 percent in the first and second quarters, respectively – declines that were directly related to the effects of the global pandemic as well as the social-distancing measures and mandated business closures implemented in mid-March. Two major components of GDP – private consumption and private fixed investment – grew at double-digit paces, and the change in private inventories also made a strong positive contribution to growth in the third quarter. Two other components – government expenditures and net exports – subtracted from GDP growth in Q3, but in the case of net exports, the silver lining was that surging imports reflected much stronger domestic demand. Private domestic final purchases – the sum of personal consumption, business fixed investment, and residential investment – advanced 38.1 percent in the third quarter, after declining by 32.4 percent in the second quarter.

PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY

Real personal consumer expenditures (PCE), which accounts for about two-thirds of overall GDP, grew 40.7 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. The surge recovered 71 percent of the consumption lost in the first and second quarters combined. Purchases of durable goods – a category that includes motor vehicles, household equipment and furnishings, among other items – spiked 82.2 percent in the third quarter, after slipping 1.7 percent in the second quarter. Purchases of nondurable goods – such as food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption, gasoline and other energy goods, clothing, footwear, and other goods – increased 28.8 percent in the third quarter, following a 15.0 percent decline in the second quarter. Meanwhile, household expenditures on services – the component of PCE most severely affected by the pandemic and related measures – rebounded by 38.4 percent in the third quarter. Even with the rebound in household expenditures for services, spending in Q3 was down $660 billion at an annual rate from its level at the end of 2019. The loss partly reflected households shifting spending that they could not spend on services toward goods: purchases of durable and nondurable goods were $325 billion (annualized) above their level at the end of 2019. Overall, real personal consumption expenditures added 25.3 percentage points to the rise in total GDP in Q3.

Business fixed investment (BFI) rose 20.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, in sharp contrast with the 27.2 percent drop in the second quarter. Driving the overall gain in third quarter BFI, equipment investment soared by 70.1 percent (particularly reflecting spending on transportation equipment), as it recovered handsomely from a 35.9 percent plunge in the second quarter. In contrast, investment in structures fell for the fourth consecutive quarter. In the most recent two quarters, this has partly reflected lower oil prices and a pull-back in petroleum exploration and development of wells; according to private sources, the average rig count declined about 35 percent in Q3. But the pandemic, through the continued use of telework, and other factors, such as the shift from brick-and-mortar retail stores to online retail, have also played a role in dampening appetite for new structures, especially for commercial investment.

After contributing to growth in every quarter from early 2015 to early 2020, expenditures on intellectual property products (IPP) were down for the second consecutive quarter. Even so, the third quarter's 1.0 percent decline was modest after the 11.4 percent decrease in the second quarter. Looking at the components, investment in software recovered in the third quarter, growing 2.6 percent after a 5.9 percent decline in the previous quarter. But research and development spending and investment in entertainment, literary, and artistic originals each declined for the third consecutive quarter, though more modestly in the third quarter than in the second. Despite the rescission of stay-at-home orders in most locales, many movie theaters and other entertainment venues remained closed in Q3; thus, the

declines in that category partly reflect lower corporate expenditures on artistic IPP. Overall, total business fixed investment added 2.9 percentage points to real GDP growth in the third quarter, after subtracting 3.7 percentage points from growth in the second quarter.

The change in private inventories, a volatile component, added 6.6 percentage points to economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, after the partial economic shutdown forced firms to draw down inventories in the second quarter.

Apart from a sharp and temporary decline in the second quarter, residential investment has grown in four of the past five quarters, including a 59.3 percent rebound in the third quarter, its largest advance since 1983. Residential investment added 2.1 percentage points to growth in the third quarter, after the sharp and temporary decline in this component posed a drag on growth in the second quarter of 1.6 percentage points. Despite the overall decline in residential investment in the second quarter, the housing sector has been recovering since May and continues to perform very well, supported in part by record-low mortgage rates and new record-highs in builder confidence. Housing starts and permits have grown strongly since May. As of October, single-family housing starts were 14.0 percent above their February level, and single-family building permits – a leading indicator for starts – were 12.7 percent above pre-pandemic levels. Buoyed by record-low mortgage rates, demand for homes has far exceeded supply. Existing home sales, which account for 90 percent of all home sales, rose in October to their highest level in fourteen years and were up nearly 27 percent over the past year. New single-family home sales reached a thirteen-year high in August before pulling back slightly in September; nonetheless, sales were still nearly 34 percent above pre-pandemic levels. In November, the National Association of Home Builder's home builder confidence index rose to a fresh record high, conveying a strongly positive view about housing market conditions. Average rates for 30-year mortgages have recently set new record lows and are now more than 2 percentage points below levels in mid-November 2018. Low rates have helped boost affordability despite recent, rapid gains in home prices, the latter reflecting a growing imbalance between supply and demand.

Government spending declined 4.5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, as Federal spending was down 6.2 percent at an annual rate, and state and local government expenditures fell 3.3 percent. Nonetheless, the decline in Federal spending followed a 16.4 percent jump in the second quarter, which reflected the implementation of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act after its passage at the end of last March. Meanwhile, state and local governments reduced their spending by 3.3 percent in the third quarter, following a 5.4 percent reduction in the second quarter. Even so, total government spending pared only 0.7 percentage point from real GDP growth in the third quarter, after contributing 0.8 percentage point in the second quarter.

The net export deficit increased $235.7 billion at an annual rate during the third quarter to $1.01 trillion, as a surge in imports more than offset a very strong increase in exports. Total exports of goods and services grew by 59.7 percent, while imports advanced 91.1 percent. The widening of the trade deficit subtracted 3.1 percentage points from third quarter GDP growth; in the second quarter, net exports contributed 0.6 percentage point to economic growth.

Labor Markets and Wages

Due to the pandemic, the economy lost almost 22.2 million jobs in March and April. However, payroll job growth resumed in May, and labor markets reclaimed 12.1 million jobs between May and October, or almost 55 percent of the total lost. This is a sharper labor recovery than previously seen. For example, the economy did not start materially adding payroll jobs until nine months after the Great Recession ended, and it took another 2½ years from that point to recover 55 percent of the jobs lost.

Likewise, the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent to a post-World War II high of 14.7 percent in April. Yet by October, the unemployment rate had fallen 7.8 percentage points to 6.9 percent, the sharpest six-month decrease on record. After the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, well after the Great Recession ended, it took over seven years to bring about the same proportionate reduction. Moreover, a large share of those currently unemployed continue to identify themselves as “temporarily laid off,” contrasting sharply with the persistently high levels of long-term unemployment during and after the Great Recession.

The headline labor force participation rate (LFPR) – as well as prime-age (ages 25-54) LFPR – reached multi-year highs earlier in 2020, before declining to multi-year lows in April. These measures have trended higher since then. As of October, the headline LFPR stood at 61.7 percent, or 1.5 percentage points above April’s 4 ½ decade low, and the prime-age LFPR was 81.2 percent, or 1.3 percentage points above April’s multi-decade low.

Nominal average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers rose 4.5 percent over the year ending in October 2020, faster than the 3.8 percent pace over the 12 months through October 2019. October marked the 27th month that this measure of wage growth has remained above 3 percent, a consistency not seen since the mid-2000s. Outsized gains over the past eight months reflected higher job losses among lower wage workers, but even with rehiring of many of these workers, wage gains remain elevated, and more subdued inflation has boosted gains in real terms. Real average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the year through October 2020, accelerating from the year-earlier pace of 2.2 percent. Wages and salaries for private industry workers, as measured by the Employment Cost Index, advanced 2.7 percent over the four quarters ending in September 2020, slowing from the 3.0 percent gain over the four quarters through September 2019.

Nonfarm Productivity of Labor

For the thirteen quarters through 2019 Q4, four-quarter nonfarm business labor productivity growth rates remained above 1 percent, a consistency not seen since 2004. However, with the sudden collapse in output in March 2020 productivity growth declined 0.3 percent at an annual rate in Q1. Over the four quarters through 2020 Q1, growth slowed to 0.9 percent - the first year-over-year reading below 1 percent since 2016 Q3. Productivity growth then surged by 10.6 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter. Taken together, these were the largest quarterly increases in productivity since the fourth quarter of 2009. Growth was up 4.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, reflecting a

43.5 percent surge in output, which more than offset a 36.8 percent increase in worker hours. Over the four quarters through 2020 Q3, productivity growth accelerated to 4.1 percent from a 1.7 percent pace over the four quarters through 2019 Q3.

Nominal hourly compensation costs in the nonfarm business sector declined 4.4 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, following the second quarter's 20.0 percent gain. Over the most recent four quarters, hourly compensation costs rose 6.7 percent, more than double the 2.9 percent, year-earlier pace. Unit labor costs, defined as the average cost of labor per unit of output, fell 8.9 percent in the third quarter, after climbing 8.5 percent in the second quarter. These costs were up 2.5 percent over the most recent four quarters, accelerating from the 1.2 percent pace over the four quarters ending in 2019's third quarter.

Industrial Production, Manufacturing, and Services

Due to the pandemic, measures of industrial production, manufacturing, and services output began declining in March and fell further in April. A quick recovery began in May as social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders were relaxed. In October, industrial output at factories, mines, and utilities was up 1.1 percent. However, over the 12 months ending in October, output was down 5.3 percent, and was still 5.6 percent lower than pre-pandemic levels.

Manufacturing production, which accounts for about 75 percent of all industrial output, increased 1.0 percent in October but was still down 3.9 percent over the past year, as well as 4.8 percent lower since February. After huge monthly gains over the summer as factories reopened, production of motor vehicles and parts edged down 0.1 percent in October but was still 6.9 percent higher over the year (although 5.1 percent lower since February). Meanwhile, manufacturing output at select high-technology factories increased 1.7 percent in October and was 6.0 percent higher than before the pandemic. Excluding motor vehicles and parts and high-technology industries, manufacturing output rose 1.1 percent in October, but this measure was 5.0 percent lower over the past year.

Output at mines, which includes crude oil and natural gas extraction and accounts for 15 percent of industrial output, declined 0.6 percent in October. Mining output was down 14.4 percent over the year, due in part to low energy prices.

Utilities output, the remaining 10 percent of total industrial output, grew 3.9 percent in October. Weather is usually a factor contributing to swings in this sector; unseasonable weather in months often causes sharp swings in output from one period to the next. Over the 12 months through October, utilities production declined 3.0 percent.

After dropping sharply in March and April, other measures of manufacturing and services production in the

economy have recovered and are signaling expansion. Since August 2019, the Institute of Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing index had been below, or marginally above, the 50-point growth threshold. However due to the pandemic, the ISM index signaled the first multi-month contraction for the manufacturing sector since early 2016. By April 2020, this index had dropped to an eleven-year low, but as of October, it stood at 59.3, indicating expansion in this sector for the fifth consecutive month. In the service sector, the ISM’s non-manufacturing index had remained consistently above the growth threshold since February 2010, but by April, had dropped to its lowest level since March 2009. By October, however, the non-manufacturing index had risen to 56.6, moving well above pre-pandemic levels to signal expansion for the fifth consecutive month.

Prices

The deflationary pressures that emerged in March at the headline as well as core levels dissipated quickly. In recent months, inflation readings have been low but generally positive. Even though 12-month inflation rates remain below year-ago levels, the gaps are narrowing, on balance. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items was unchanged in October, still reflecting lower prices in pandemic-affected sectors. Over the 12 months through October, CPI inflation was 1.2 percent, or 0.6 percentage point below the year-earlier pace. Energy prices have stabilized in recent weeks, but over the year through October, were still 9.2 percent lower, extending the 4.2 percent decline over the year through October 2019. After accelerating sharply earlier this year, monthly food price inflation has tapered considerably in recent months. Even so, the CPI for food was up 3.9 percent over the year through October, reflecting increased demand for food at home due to the pandemic. The year-over-year pace in October was nearly double the 2.1 percent pace over the 12 months through October 2019. Meanwhile, core CPI inflation was also flat in October. Over the past 12 months, core inflation was 1.6 percent, quite a bit slower than the 2.3 percent pace over the year through October 2019.

The headline Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index (the preferred measure for the FOMC's 2 percent inflation target) also shows a restrained pace of inflation. The 12-month headline PCE inflation rate was 1.4 percent through September 2020, matching its year-earlier rate. Core PCE inflation was 1.5 percent over the year through September 2020, slowing modestly from the 1.7 percent, year-earlier rate. Inflation as measured by the PCE price index has held below the FOMC's target since November 2018, and these consistently low PCE inflation readings recently prompted the FOMC to adopt a more explicit inflation target strategy in which the 2 percent target would be an average over time.

Measures of house price growth have accelerated, reflecting higher demand and lower supply. FHFA price growth surged to an 8.1 percent pace over the twelve months

through August 2020 from a 4.8 percent gain over the previous year. On a 12-month basis, the Standard and Poor's (S&P)/Case-Shiller composite 20-city home price index advanced 5.2 percent over the year through August, more than double the 2.0 percent advance over the 12 months through August 2019.

Consumer Prices

(Percent change from a year earlier)

Consumer and Business Sentiment

After improving strongly through most of the first quarter, measures of consumer and business sentiment pulled back in March as social distancing and business closures took effect. After rising to 101.0 in February, just shy of the 14-year high reached in 2018, the Reuters/Michigan consumer sentiment index subsequently fell by more than 29 points. This index has since trended higher, standing at 77.0 as of early November, but it remains about 20 points below its February level. From February, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index plunged by 46.9 points to 85.7 in April, reaching its lowest level since mid-2014. This index has also trended higher since then, rising to 100.9 in October, but is still nearly 32 points below the level in February. On the business side, the National Federation of Independent Business's (NFIB) small business optimism index was, as of February, only 4.3 points below its all-time high reached in August 2018. But this index fell nearly 14 points over March and April to its lowest level since March 2013. Small business optimism has since recovered noticeably, and this index stood at 104.0 as of October, only 0.5 points below its level in February.

Federal Budget and Debt

Even before the pandemic, the Federal Government's deficit and debt were trending higher, but the pandemic

spurred even more spending and borrowing. In March and April, Congress passed several bills to help combat COVID-19 and ameliorate the economic effects of social distancing measures, worth about $2.7 trillion. At the end of FY 2020, the Federal Government posted a deficit of $3.13 trillion (14.9 percent of GDP), up $2.15 trillion from the $984 billion deficit (4.6 percent of GDP) posted in FY 2019. The primary deficit (which excludes net interest payments) was 13.3 percent of GDP in FY 2020, up from 2.9 percent in FY 2019. Federal receipts totaled $3.42 trillion in FY 2020, down $44 billion (1.2 percent) from FY 2019. Net outlays for FY 2020 were $6.55 trillion, up $2.1 trillion (47.3 percent) from FY 2019.

The Treasury's borrowing limit is suspended until July 31, 2021. At the end of FY 2020, gross federal debt was $26,945.4 billion. Federal debt held by the public, or federal debt less the debt held in government accounts, rose from $16.80 trillion at the end of FY 2019 (79.2 percent of GDP) to $21.0 trillion by the end of FY 2020, or 100.1 percent of GDP.

Economic Policy

The U.S. government has responded to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with a range of significantly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, including an unprecedented level of fiscal assistance and a reduction in the key policy interest rate to near-zero.

On the fiscal side, Congress has authorized a record-setting economic aid package of roughly $2.7 trillion to date. The Federal Government has aided Americans through Economic Impact Payments and has helped the unemployed by adding a temporary weekly federal benefit to normal state unemployment compensation and expanding eligibility for benefits to the self-employed and gig workers. The Administration also postponed tax payments and delayed loan payments for borrowers of federally backed student loans to boost disposable incomes and help American households to weather the pandemic.

In addition, Treasury and the Small Business Administration (SBA) launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) less than a week after its authorization at the end of March. The Administration worked directly with private lenders and used their infrastructure to hasten how quickly businesses could receive funds. In less than two weeks, the PPP had exhausted its initial funding: it had processed nearly 1.7 million loans worth $342 billion. After a second appropriation, the PPP has provided nearly 5 million loans to date, worth over $520 billion. According to the SBA, lenders have reported that over 51 million jobs have been supported by PPP loans. By comparison, the Census Bureau estimated in the most recent Statistics of U.S. Businesses that establishments with fewer than 500 employees employed approximately 60.6 million workers.

On the monetary policy side, the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) resumed

PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY

monetary easing, which began in July 2019 but had been paused at the turn of the year, owing to buoyant economic conditions.

At the January 2020 meeting, the Federal funds rate target was unchanged at a range of 1½ to 2 percent, and in the accompanying statement, the Committee observed that at the time, "the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the [Fed's 2 percent target]."

However, the pandemic led to an inter-meeting move. On March 3, the FOMC announced a 50-basis point cut in the target range to 1 to 1¼ percent, and on March 15, at another unscheduled meeting, the FOMC cut the target range by 100 basis points to 0 to ¼ percent. (The scheduled, March 17-18 FOMC meeting was cancelled.)

At its scheduled meetings in April, June, July, September, and November, the FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged.

In each of the accompanying statements for those meetings, the Committee noted that it expects to maintain this FFR target range "until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."

The Federal Reserve has also implemented large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. Importantly, the Federal Reserve assuaged market worries by using its Section 13(3) authority to establish numerous emergency lending facilities. Through these facilities, it leveraged capital provided by Treasury, which committed $215 billion of capital. Although the Federal Reserve had used only 3.2 percent of its stated lending capacity by the end of July, the existence of these facilities unlocked financial markets and mitigated the risk of the public health crisis from becoming a financial crisis.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usually takes the form of appropriations that allow obligations to be incurred and payments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have expired or would otherwise expire. These are counted as new budget authority in the fiscal year of the legislation in which the reappropriation act is included, regardless of when the amounts were originally appropriated or when they would otherwise lapse.

Obligations generally are liquidated by the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash—outlays. Obligations may also be liquidated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts. Total Government receipts are compared with total outlays in calculating the budget surplus or deficit.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipt accounts). The former normally can be used without an appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements to appropriations. For accounting purposes, earned reimbursements are also known as revenues. These offsetting collections are netted against gross outlays in determining net outlays from such appropriations; and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust); offsetting collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into three categories: (1) proprietary receipts, or collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function; (2) intragovernmental transactions, or payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts. They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts; and (3) offsetting governmental receipts that include foreign cash contributions.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions—payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and outlays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept set forth in the “Report of the President’s Commission on Budget Concepts” as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1969. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government’s fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them outside of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Postal Service.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit ordinarily are not subject to targets set by the Congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (2 United States Code 900-922)] included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused

on both on- and off-budget receipts, outlays and deficit of the Government.

Tables FFO-1, FFO-2, and FFO-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, estimates for 2 years, detail for 13 months, and fiscal year-to-date data. They provide a summary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal entities and disbursing officers, and daily reports from the FRBs. They also detail accounting transactions affecting receipts and outlays of the Government and off-budget Federal entities and their related effect on assets and liabilities of the Government. Data are derived from the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government."

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets, and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FFO-2 includes on- and off-budget receipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FFO-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FFO-4 summarizes on- and off-budget receipts by source and outlays by function as reported to each major fund group classification for the current fiscal year to date and prior fiscal year to date.

Table FF0-5 summarizes internal revenue receipts by states and by type of tax. Amounts reported are collections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), payments made with tax returns and subsequent payments made after tax returns are due or are filed (that is, payments with delinquent returns or on delinquent accounts).

Amounts are reported based on the primary filing address provided by each taxpayer or reporting entity. For multistate corporations, the address may reflect only the district where such a corporation reported its taxes from a principal office rather than other districts where income was earned or where individual income and Social Security taxes were withheld. In addition, an individual may reside in one district and work in another.

Table FFO-6 includes customs collection of duties, taxes, and fees by districts and ports.

Fourth-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the Fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 supplements fiscal data reported in the September issue of the “Treasury Bulletin.” At the time of that issue’s release, not enough data were available to analyze adequately collections for the quarter.

Note that due to the delay of certain tax payment deadlines under IRS Notices 2020-18 and 2020-23, differences between the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 may be unusually large.

Individual income taxes—Individual income tax receipts, net of refunds, were $624.1 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This is an increase of $207.7 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Withheld receipts decreased by $54.3 billion and non-withheld receipts increased by $284.1 billion during this period. The increase was due in part to a Treasury Notice that allowed payment of taxes otherwise due on April 15, 2020 to be delayed without penalty until July 15, 2020. Refunds increased by $22.2 billion over the comparable fiscal year 2019 quarter. There was a negligible change in accounting adjustments between individual income tax receipts and the

Social Security and Medicare trust funds over the comparable quarter in fiscal year 2019.

Corporate income taxes—Net corporate income tax receipts were $119.7 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This is an increase of $53.8 billion compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The increase was due in part to a Treasury Notice that allowed payment of taxes otherwise due on April 15, 2020 to be delayed without penalty until July 15, 2020. The $53.8 billion change is comprised of an increase of $63.0 billion in estimated and final payments, and an increase of $9.2 billion in corporate refunds.

Employment taxes and contributions—Employment taxes and contributions receipts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $303.4 billion, an increase of $19.0 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Federal Disability Insurance, and Federal Hospital Insurance trust funds changed by $10.3 billion, $1.7 billion, and $3.8 billion respectively. There was a negligible accounting adjustment for prior years employment tax liabilities made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. There was also a negligible adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

Unemployment insurance—Unemployment insurance receipts, net of refunds, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $9.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion over the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2019. Net State taxes deposited in the U.S. Treasury increased by $1.9 billion to $8.7 billion. Net Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes decreased by $0.2 billion to $0.6 billion.

Contributions for other insurance and retirement—Contributions for other retirement were $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This was an increase of $0.1 billion from the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2019.

Excise taxes—Net excise tax receipts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $40.1 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Total excise tax refunds for the quarter were $3.6 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Estate and gift taxes—Net estate and gift tax receipts were $6.5 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. These receipts represent an increase of $2.2 billion over the same quarter in fiscal year 2019.

Customs duties—Customs duties net of refunds were $17.0 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. This is a decrease of $3.4 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Miscellaneous receipts—Net miscellaneous receipts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $38.6 billion, an increase of $13.1 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. This change is due in part to deposits of earnings by Federal Reserve banks increasing by $14.0 billion.

1 Gross collections include penalties and interest in addition to taxes.
2 Includes taxes on corporation income (Form 1120 series) and unrelated business income from tax-exempt organizations (Form 990–T).
3 Collections of withheld individual income tax are not reported by taxpayers separately from Old-Age, Survivors, Disability, and Hospital Insurance (OASDHI) taxes on salaries and wages (under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or FICA) and taxes on self-employment income (under the Self-Employment Insurance Contributions Act or SECA). Thus, while Table 1 shows these amounts separately for the United States total, separate amounts are not available by State.
4 Excludes excise taxes collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The Internal Revenue Service collected taxes on alcohol and tobacco until Fiscal Year 1988, and taxes on firearms until Fiscal Year 1991.
5 Includes tax and excess withholding payments not classified by State as of the end of the fiscal year because they had not been applied to taxpayer accounts. Undistributed amounts may be negative when adjustments to taxpayer accounts have not been completed.
Note—Partnership, S corporation, regulated investment company, and real estate investment trust data are not shown in this table since these entities generally do not have a tax liability. Instead, they pass through any profits or losses to the underlying owners, who include these profits or losses on their income tax returns.

Note—This table shows gross collections. Gross collections less refunds equal net collections. See Table 1 for refunds and net collections.
Note— Collection and refund data may not be comparable for a given fiscal year because payments made in prior years may be refunded in the current fiscal year. Adjustments to prior-year refunds made in Fiscal Year 2019 may result in negative amounts when such adjustments exceed current-year collections. See Table 8 for refund data.
Note— Classification by State is based on the individual's address (or, in the case of businesses, the location of the principal office or place of business). However, some individuals may use the address of a tax attorney or accountant. Sole proprietors may use their business addresses. Such addresses could have been located in a State other than the State in which the individual resided.
Similarly, taxes withheld and reported by employers located near a State boundary might include substantial amounts withheld from salaries of employees who reside in a neighboring State. Also, while taxes of corporations may be paid from the principal office, the operations of these corporations may be located in one or more other State(s).
Detail may not add to totals because of rounding.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities issued by other Federal agencies accounting for the rest. Tables in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" reflect the total. Further detailed information is published in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Likewise, information on agency securities and on investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government."

Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" tables FD-2 and FD-6 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States."

Table FD-1 summarizes the Federal debt by listing public debt and agency securities held by the public, including the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agencies, largely by the Social Security and other Federal retirement trust funds. The net unamortized premium and discount also are listed by total Federal securities, securities held by Government accounts and securities held by the public. The difference between the outstanding face value of the Federal debt and the net unamortized premium and discount is classified as the accrual amount. (For greater detail on holdings of Federal securities by particular classes of investors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type, that is, marketable and nonmarketable, the total public debt securities outstanding that are held by the public.

In table FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by issues to particular funds within Government. Many of the funds invest in par value special series nonmarketables at interest rates determined by law. Others invest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents interest-bearing securities issued by Government agencies. Federal agency borrowing

has declined in recent years, in part because the Federal Financing Bank has provided financing to other Federal agencies. (Federal agency borrowing from Treasury is presented in the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.")

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt.

In March 1971, Congress enacted a limited exception to the amount of bonds with rates greater than 4-1/4 percent that could be held by the public. This permitted Treasury to offer securities maturing in more than 7 years at current market interest rates for the first time since 1965. In March 1976, the definition of a bond was changed to include those securities longer than 10 years to maturity. This exception has expanded since 1971, authorizing Treasury to continue to issue long-term securities. The ceiling on Treasury bonds was repealed on November 10, 1988.

The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the FRBs.

In table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Bureau of the Fiscal Service Operations

Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment, and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each outstanding marketable security is listed in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." The information in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" pertains only to marketable Treasury securities.

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is a new bureau within the Treasury Department, formed on October 7, 2012, from the consolidation of the Financial Management Service and the Bureau of the Public Debt. Our mission is to promote the financial integrity and operational efficiency of the U.S. government through exceptional accounting, financing, collections, payments, and shared services. As one bureau, the organization is better positioned to help transform financial management and the delivery of shared services in the federal government. The bureau will be a valued partner for agencies as they work to strengthen their own financial management or as they look for a quality service provider who can allow them to focus on their missions.

Table PDO-1 presents the results of weekly auctions of 4-, 13-, and 26-week bills. Treasury bills mature each Thursday. Issues of 4- and 13-week bills are reopenings of 26-week bills. High rates on accepted tenders and the dollar value of total bids are presented, with the dollar value of awards made on both competitive and noncompetitive basis.

To encourage the participation of individuals and smaller institutions, Treasury accepts noncompetitive tenders of up to $5 million in each auction of securities.

Table PDO-2 lists the results of auctions of marketable securities, other than weekly bills, in chronological order over the past 2 years. Issues of cash management bills also are presented.

Note: On July 31, 2013, Treasury published amendments to its marketable securities auction rules to accommodate the auction and issuance of Floating Rate Notes (FRNs).

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, notes, and bonds that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. [See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.]

Effective January 1, 2001, Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service revised formats, titles, and column headings in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States," Table I: Summary of Treasury Securities Outstanding and Table II: Statutory Debt Limit. These changes should reduce confusion and bring the publication more in line with the public's use of terms.

Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" table OFS-1 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Effective June 2001, Bureau of the Fiscal Service revised procedures and categories in this table to agree with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's publication changes.

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and nonmarketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the FRBs, and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The FRBs acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated ownership of U.S. Treasury securities. Information is primarily obtained from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds data, Table L209. State, local, and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and foreign official accounts. They also include municipal, foreign official, and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes to the table for description of investor categories.)

The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion deemed to be in circulation. It includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate or that may do so to a limited extent. Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various issues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census. USCC information has been published by Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when it was incorporated into the "Treasury Bulletin." The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs), and the Federal Reserve Board.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

The "Treasury Bulletin" reports foreign currency holdings of large foreign exchange market participants. These reports provide information on positions in derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange futures and options that are increasingly used in establishing foreign exchange positions but were not covered in the old reports.

The information is based on reports of large foreign exchange market participants on holdings of five major foreign currencies (Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound sterling, and euro) and the U.S. dollar. Positions in the U.S. dollar, which have been collected since January 1999, are intended to approximate "all other" currency positions of reporting institutions. U.S.-based businesses file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, branches, and agencies. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Filing is required by law (31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Regulations 128, Subpart C).

Weekly and monthly reports must be filed throughout the calendar year by major foreign exchange market participants, which are defined as market participants with more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (end March, September, September, or December). Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold.

A quarterly report must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange market participant that had more than $5 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any quarter the previous year (end March, June, September, or December).

This information is published in six sections corresponding to each of the major currencies covered by the reports. Tables I-1 through VI-1 present the currency data reported weekly by major market participants. Tables I-2 through VI-2 present more detailed currency data of major market participants, based on monthly reports. Tables I-3 through VI-3 present quarterly consolidated currency data reported by large market participants that do not file weekly reports. The information in the tables referenced above is based on the reports referenced in this Introduction: Foreign Currency Positions and is not audited by the Federal Reserve banks or the Treasury Department.

Principal exchanged under cross-currency interest rate swaps is reported as part of purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Such principal also was noted separately on monthly and quarterly reports through December 1998, when this practice was discontinued. The net options position, or the net delta-equivalent value of an options position, is an estimate of the relationship between an option's value and an equivalent currency hedge. The delta equivalent value is defined as the product of the first partial derivative of an option valuation formula (with respect to the price of the underlying currency) multiplied by the notional principal of the contract.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established pursuant to chapter 6, section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 codified at 31 United States Code 5302, which authorized establishment of a Treasury fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose somewhat to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Section 4027 of H.R. 748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), enacted on March 27, 2020 as Pub. Law 116-136, appropriated $500 billion to the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use to make loans, loan guarantees, and other investments in support of eligible businesses, States, and municipalities and to provide the subsidy amounts necessary for such loans, loan guarantees, and other investments in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.). The CARES Act appropriation is used to fund the credit subsidy portion of loans, loan guarantees, and other investments authorized under section 4003 of the CARES Act, and the remaining portion of such disbursements is funded by borrowings from Treasury through the Bureau of Fiscal Service. This appropriated balance and borrowings from Treasury are held as a fund balance with Treasury until disbursed.

Resources of the fund include (a) Fund Balance, which reflects the appropriation from the CARES Act minus the net credit subsidy portion of all investments and loans receivable and expenditures for administrative expenses in

support of the CARES Act, (b) U.S. Government securities (dollar balances), (c) special drawing rights -SDRs, and (d) foreign currencies. Principal sources of income -- or loss -- for the fund are profits -- or losses -- on SDRs and foreign exchange, interest earned on U.S Government and foreign securities, SDRs, and other non-CARES Act facilities.

Table ESF-1 presents the assets, liabilities, and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars. Amounts and transactions pertaining to foreign currencies have been converted to U.S. dollars based on current exchange rates computed according to the accrual method of accounting. Investments and loans receivable are reported at cost. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the International Monetary Fund. The additional appropriated capital represents the $500 billion appropriated under the CARES Act Sec 4003 minus transfers and expenditures. Conversion gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income +- or loss -- account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations for the current quarter and year-to-date. Figures are in U.S. dollars computed according to the accrual method. “Profit -- or loss -- on foreign exchange” includes realized profits or losses. “Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations” reflects net gain or loss on revaluation of SDR holdings and allocations for the quarter. CARES Act related administrative costs incurred in connection with the loans, loan guarantees and other investments are accrued.

Note—Annual balance sheets for fiscal years 1934 through 1940 appeared in the 1940 "Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury" and those for succeeding years appeared in subsequent reports through 1980. Quarterly balance sheets beginning with December 31, 1938, have been published in the "Treasury Bulletin." Data from inception to September 30, 1978, may be found on the statements published in the January 1979 "Treasury Bulletin."

TABLE TF-6A—Highway Trust Fund

The Highway Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1957, according to provisions of the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (Act of June 29, 1956, chapter 462, section 209). It has been amended and extended by various highway surface transportation and other acts since 1959. The FAST Act extends through September 30, 2021, the authority to make expenditures from the Highway Trust Fund for authorized purposes. After that date, expenditures from the Trust Fund are authorized only to liquidate obligations made before that date. Any other expenditure will cause the cessation of deposits of highway-user taxes to the Trust Fund. [FAST Act § 31101, 26 U.S.C. 9503].

Amounts equivalent to taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuels, certain tires, heavy trucks and trailers, and heavy vehicle use are designated by the Act to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to Highway Account of the trust fund. These transfers are made twice monthly based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to later adjustments to reflect the amount of actual tax receipts. Amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in non-interest-bearing public debt securities.

The Highway Trust Fund's Mass Transit Account is funded by a portion of the excise tax collections under sections 4041 and 4081 of the IRC (title 26 United States Code). The funds from this account are used for expenditures in accordance with chapter 53 of title 49 United States Code, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), SAFETEA-LU, Moving Ahead for Progress

in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and as amended by Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The remaining excise taxes are included in a separate account within the trust fund commonly referred to as the highway account. Expenditures from this account are made according to the provisions of various transportation acts.

Amounts required for outlays to carry out the eligible surface transportation programs are made available to the responsible operating administrations within the Department of Transportation. Other charges to the trust fund are made by the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer of certain taxes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund.

In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is required by 26 U.S.C. 9503(d)(7) to report to specified Congressional Committees any estimate which he, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, makes pursuant to 26 U.S.C.

9503(d)(1) or any determination which he makes pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 9503(d)(2). The congressional committees are the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Committees on the Budget of both Houses, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.

Glossary With References to Applicable Sections and Tables

Source: Bureau of the Fiscal Service

Amounts outstanding and in circulation (USCC)—Includes all issues by the Bureau of the Mint purposely intended as a medium of exchange. Coins sold by the Bureau of the Mint at premium prices are excluded; however, uncirculated coin sets sold at face value plus handling charge are included.

Average discount rate (PDO-1, -2)—In Treasury bill auctions, purchasers tender competitive bids on a discount rate basis. The average discount rate is the weighted, or adjusted, average of all bids accepted in the auction.

Budget authority (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Congress passes laws giving budget authority to Government entities, which gives the agencies the power to spend Federal funds. Congress can stipulate various criteria for the spending of these funds. For example, Congress can stipulate that a given agency must spend within a specific year, number of years, or any time in the future.

The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, authority to borrow, contract authority, and authority to obligate and expend offsetting receipts and collections. The period of time during which Congress makes funds available may be specified as 1-year, multiple-year, or no-year. The available amount may be classified as either definite or indefinite; a specific amount or an unspecified amount can be made available. Authority also may be classified as current or permanent. Permanent authority requires no current action by Congress.

Budget deficit—The total, cumulative amount by which budget outlays (spending) exceed budget receipts (income).

Cash management bills (PDO-1)—Marketable Treasury bills of irregular maturity lengths, sold periodically to fund short-term cash needs of Treasury. Their sale, having higher minimum and multiple purchase requirements than those of other issues, is generally restricted to competitive bidders.

Competitive tenders (“Treasury Financing Operations”)—A bid to purchase a stated amount of one issue of Treasury securities at a specified yield or discount. The bid is accepted if it is within the range accepted in the auction. (See Noncompetitive tenders.)

Currency no longer issued (USCC)—Old and new series gold and silver certificates, Federal Reserve notes, national bank notes, and 1890 Series Treasury notes.

Debt outstanding subject to limitation (FD-6)—The debt incurred by the Treasury subject to the statutory limit set by Congress. Until World War I, a specific amount of debt was authorized to each separate security issue. Beginning with the

Second Liberty Loan Act of 1917, the nature of the limitation was modified until, in 1941, it developed into an overall limit on the outstanding Federal debt.

Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3101(b). By the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Bipartisan Budget Act, 2018, Public Law 115-119, the Statutory Debt Limit was suspended through March 1, 2019.

Discount—The interest deducted in advance when purchasing notes or bonds. (See Accrued discount.)

Discount rate (PDO-1)—The difference between par value and the actual purchase price paid, annualized over a 360-day year. Because this rate is less than the actual yield (coupon-equivalent rate), the yield should be used in any comparison with coupon issue securities.

Dollar coins (USCC)—Include standard silver and nonsilver coins.

Domestic series (FD-2)—Nonmarketable, interest- and non-interest-bearing securities issued periodically by Treasury to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RFC) for investment of funds authorized under section 21B of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 United States Code 1441b).

Federal intrafund transactions (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Intrabudgetary transactions in which payments and receipts both occur within the same Federal fund group (Federal funds or trust funds).

Federal Reserve notes (USCC)—Issues by the U.S. Government to the public through the Federal Reserve banks and their member banks. They represent money owed by the Government to the public. Currently, the item “Federal Reserve notes—amounts outstanding” consists of new series issues. The Federal Reserve note is the only class of currency currently issued.

Foreign-targeted issue (PDO-2)—Foreign-targeted issues were notes sold between October 1984 and February 1986 to foreign institutions, foreign branches of U.S. institutions, foreign central banks or monetary authorities, or to international organizations in which the United States held membership. Sold as companion issues, they could be converted to domestic (normal) Treasury notes with the same maturity and interest rates. Interest was paid annually.

Government account series (FD-2)—Certain trust fund statutes require the Secretary of the Treasury to apply monies held by these funds toward the issuance of nonmarketable special securities. These securities are sold directly by

December 2020

88

Treasury to a specific Government agency, trust fund, or account. Their rate is based on an average of market yields on outstanding Treasury obligations, and they may be redeemed at the option of the holder. Roughly 80 percent of these are issued to five holders: the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; the civil service retirement and disability fund; the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the military retirement fund; and the Unemployment Trust Fund.

Interfund transactions (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Transactions in which payments are made from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in another group.

International Monetary Fund transactions ("Exchange Stabilization Fund", ESF-1)—(IMF) Established by the United Nations, the IMF promotes international trade, stability of exchange, and monetary cooperation. Members are allowed to draw from the fund.

Intrabudgetary transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—These occur when payment and receipt both occur within the budget, or when payment is made from off-budget Federal entities whose budget authority and outlays are excluded from the budget totals.

Noncompetitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—This is a tender or bid to purchase a stated par amount of securities at the highest yield or discount rate awarded to competitive bidders for a single-price auction.

Obligations ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—An unpaid commitment to acquire goods or services.

Off-budget Federal entities (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)— Federally owned and controlled entities whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals under provisions of law. Their receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit are not included in budget receipts, outlays, or deficits. Their budget authority is not included in totals of the budget.

Outlays ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Payments on obligations in the form of cash, checks, the issuance of bonds or notes, or the maturing of interest coupons.

Par value—The face value of bonds or notes, including interest.

Quarterly financing (“Treasury Financing Operations”)—Treasury has historically offered packages of several “coupon” security issues on the 15th of February, May, August, and November, or on the next working day. These issues currently consist of a 3-year note, a 10-year note, and a 30-year bond. Treasury sometimes offers additional amounts of outstanding long-term notes or bonds, rather than selling new security issues. (See Reopening.)

Fractional coins (USCC)—Coins minted in denominations of 50, 25, and 10 cents, and minor coins (5 cents and 1 cent).

Receipts ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Funds collected from selling land, capital, or services, as well as collections from the public (budget receipts), such as taxes, fines, duties, and fees.

Reopening (PDO-2)—The offer for sale of additional amounts of outstanding issues, rather than an entirely new issue. A reopened issue will always have the same maturity date, CUSIP-number, and interest rate as the original issue.

Special drawing rights (“Exchange Stabilization Fund,” ESF-1)—International assets created by IMF that serve to increase international liquidity and provide additional international reserves. SDRs may be purchased and sold among eligible holders through IMF. (See IMF.)

SDR allocations are the counterpart to SDRs issued by IMF based on members' quotas in IMF. Although shown in Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) statements as liabilities, they must be redeemed by ESF only in the event of liquidation of, or U.S. withdrawal from, the SDR department of IMF or cancellation of SDRs.

SDR certificates are issued to the Federal Reserve System against SDRs when SDRs are legalized as money. Proceeds of monetization are deposited into an ESF account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Spot (“Foreign Currency Positions”)—Due for receipt or delivery within 2 workdays.

State and local government series (SLGS) (FD-2)—Special nonmarketable certificates, notes, and bonds offered to State and local governments as a means to invest proceeds from their own tax-exempt financing. Interest rates and maturities comply with IRS arbitrage provisions. SLGS are offered in both time deposit and demand deposit forms. Time deposit certificates have maturities of up to 1 year. Notes mature in 1 to 10 years and bonds mature in more than 10 years. Demand deposit securities are 1-day certificates rolled over with a rate adjustment daily.

Statutory debt limit (FD-6)—By Act of Congress there is a limit, either temporary or permanent, on the amount of public debt that may be outstanding. When this limit is reached, Treasury may not sell new debt issues until Congress increases or extends the limit. For a detailed listing of changes in the limit since 1941, see the Budget of the United States Government. (See debt outstanding subject to limitation.)

STRIPS (PDO-2)—Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Long-term notes and bonds may be divided into principal and interest-paying components, which may be transferred and sold in amounts as small as $1,000. STRIPS are sold at auction at a minimum par amount, varying for each issue. The amount is an arithmetic function of the issue’s interest rate.

December 2020
