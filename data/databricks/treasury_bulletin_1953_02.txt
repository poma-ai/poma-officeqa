Treasury Financing Operations

Refunding of the February Certificates

On January 27, 1953, the Secretary of the Treasury announced the intention of the Treasury to offer on February 2 a choice of one-year certificates of indebtedness or a five- to six-year security in exchange for the 11-1/2 month 1-7/8 percent certificates maturing on February 15. The announcement stated that of the $8,868 million total of the maturing certificates approximately $3.7 billion were held by the Federal Reserve Banks, about $2.3 billion by commercial banks, and the remainder by corporations and other nonbank investors. The bulk of the maturing certificates was thus held by investors who preferred short-term securities; the new offering, however, would give any holders who might wish to do so an opportunity to extend their maturities, the announcement concluded.

Interest rates on the offerings were announced on January 30. The interest rate on the one-year certificate is 2-1/4 percent per annum, and the alternative security is a five-year ten-month bond bearing interest at the rate of 2-1/2 percent per annum.

Full details of the certificate and bond offerings were given in the official circulars dated Monday, February 2, 1953. Exchanges were made par for par, and cash subscriptions were not received. The new certificates, Series A-1954, are dated February 15, 1953, and bear interest from that date payable with the principal at maturity on February 15, 1954. They were issued in bearer form only, in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000. The new 2-1/2 percent Treasury bonds of 1958 are

dated February 15, 1953, and bear interest from that date payable on a semiannual basis on June 15 and December 15 in each year until the principal amount becomes payable. They will mature December 15, 1958, and will not be subject to call before maturity. Bearer bonds with interest coupons attached and bonds registered as to principal and interest were issued in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000. Subcription books were closed at the close of business on February 5.

According to preliminary reports as of February 9, subscriptions for the new offerings totaled $8,731 million, approximately 98-1/2 percent of the maturing certificates. Subscriptions to the certificates, Series A-1954, totaled $8,112 million, and subscriptions to the 2-1/2 percent bonds of 1958 totaled $619 million, leaving $137 million of the total to be paid in cash.

Treasury Bills Refunded

Five issues of Treasury bills matured in January in the total of $6.9 billion. They were refunded by equivalent total and weekly issues. The offering dated January 2 was for $1.2 billion, that dated January 29 for $1.5 billion, and the offerings dated January 8, 15, and 22 were for $1.4 billion each. The average rates of discount on the new issues were 2.191 percent for January 2, 1.986 percent for January 8, 2.124 percent for January 15, 2.097 percent for January 22, and 1.961 percent for January 29.

Note: Details of Treasury market financing operations are shown elsewhere in this issue of the "Treasury Bulletin", in the tables on "Offerings" and "Dis-

position", respectively, of marketable issues of bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness, and in the table "Offerings of Treasury Bills".

1/ For basis of appropriations, see Table 7. Amounts appropriated are equivalent to the amounts of taxes collected and deposited for old-age insurance. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (Public Law 734), approved August 28, 1950, changed in certain respects the basis of transferring the appropriated funds to the trust fund. Effective January 1, 1951, the old-age insurance taxes on employers and employees and the withheld income tax are paid into the Treasury in combined amounts without separation as to type of tax. The old-age insurance tax on self-employment income, imposed by Public Law 734, is levied and collected as part of the individual income tax, beginning with the taxable year 1951. Beginning January 1951, the amounts transferred currently as appropriations to the trust fund are based on estimates of old-age insurance tax receipts made by the Secretary of the Treasury, and are adjusted in later transfers on the basis of wage and self-employment income records maintained by the Federal

Security Administrator. For purposes of this table, the amounts credited to the trust fund beginning January 1951 are considered to represent estimated receipts of old-age insurance taxes for corresponding periods. Accordingly, these amounts are included under employment taxes and excluded from total income and profits taxes as shown. Throughout the calendar year 1951, the same amounts were deducted from the combined taxes paid in by employers, and the balance was shown as income tax withheld. Beginning January 1952, the tax on self-employment income is allowed for in the amounts credited to the trust fund, but no breakdown between the two types of old-age insurance taxes is available monthly. Estimates of the breakdown are made on a fiscal year basis beginning 1952. Interest on refunds is included in Table 5 under "Miscellaneous". Since monthly figures in these two columns include old-age insurance taxes (see footnotes 2 and 3), they will not add to the total, which excludes those taxes.

1/ Fiscal year ending June 30 of year indicated.
2/ Gross receipts less appropriations to Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and refunds of receipts.
3/ Expenditures are "net", after allowance for reimbursements to appropriations, receipts of revolving fund appropriations, and receivables credited to disbursing accounts of corporations and agencies having authority to use collections without formal covering into the Treasury. The figures include transfers to trust accounts, transactions of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Trust Fund, established under the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 150), and transactions of wholly owned Government corporations and agencies.
Beginning November 1950, investments by these corporations and agencies

in public debt securities are excluded from budget expenditures and included with other such investments under "Trust account and other trans-actions". Corresponding adjustments were made in November 1950 and January 1951 for net investments classified as budget expenditures in the period July through October. Budget expenditures exclude also amounts for public debt retirement which are chargeable to the sinking fund, etc., under special provisions of law. Payments to the Treasury, principally by wholly owned Government corporations, for retirement of capital stock and disposition of earnings are excluded from both receipts and expenditures. Further information on capital transfers and the Foreign Economic Cooperation Trust Fund may be found in the 1952 Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury, pages 512 and 513.

Note: This table presents a recaptulation by months, with calendar year as well as fiscal year totals, of budget receipts by principal sources and deductions from budget receipts as they appear in Table 1. Figures as originally published for earlier years have been revised where necessary so as to place each series on a comparable basis for the whole period shown. It is planned to publish a similar recaptulation from time to time in order to bring the information up to date in convenient form for reference. Corresponding data on net receipts (gross budget receipts less deductions) are published each month in Table 6.

Fiscal year ending June 30 of year indicated.
Under Current Tax Payment Act of 1943, effective July 1, 1943, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1621-1632). Victory taxes withheld pursuant to the Revenue Act of 1942 are included in "Other income and profits taxes". Monthly and calendar year figures include old-age insurance taxes on employers and employees beginning January 1952, because those taxes are not thereafter separable currently from income tax withheld.
Fiscal year figures exclude old-age insurance taxes, on the basis of estimates beginning 1951. For further explanation, see footnote 8.

For adjustments reflected in these figures, see footnote 9. Corporation income and profits taxes and individual income tax not withheld. Monthly and calendar year figures include old-age insurance tax on self-employment income beginning with returns filed for taxable year 1951, because this tax is not separable currently from individual income tax. Fiscal year figures exclude old-age insurance tax, on the basis of estimates beginning 1952. For further explanation, see footnote 8.

5/ Partly estimated beginning January 1951 (see footnote 8).

Consists of receipts for old-age insurance under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, unemployment insurance under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (taxes on employers of 8 or more), and railroad retirement under the Railroad Retirement Act (taxes on carriers and their employees). Railroad unemployment insurance contributions for administrative expenses are included in "Other receipts". Old-age insurance taxes are partly estimated, beginn- ing January 1951 (see footnote 8).

17 Includes proceeds from sale of surplus property (act approved October 3, 1944) and from Government-owned securities, deposits resulting from renegotiation of war contracts, and repayments on credit to United Kingdom (see Table 6B, footnote 11).

Appropriations to Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund are equivalent to amounts of taxes collected and deposited for old-age insurance (42 U.S.C. 401 (a)). The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (Public Law 734), approved August 28, 1950, changed in certain respects the basis of transferring the appropriated funds to the trust fund. Effective January 1, 1951, the old-age insurance taxes on employers and employees and the withheld income tax are paid into the Treasury in combined amounts without separation as to type of tax. The old-age insurance tax on self-employment income, imposed by Public Law 734, is levied and collected as part of the individual income tax, beginning with the taxable year 1951. Beginning January 1951, the amounts transferred currently as appropriations to the trust fund are based on estimates of old-age insurance tax receipts made by the Secretary of the Treasury, and are adjusted in later transfers on the basis of wage and self-employment income records maintained by the Federal Security Administrator. For purposes of this table, the amounts credited to the trust fund beginning January 1951 are considered to represent estimated receipts of old-age insurance taxes for corresponding periods. Accordingly, these amounts are included under employment taxes and excluded from total income and profits taxes as shown. Throughout the calendar year 1951, the same amounts were deducted from the combined taxes paid in by employers, and the balance was shown as income tax withheld. Beginning January 1952, the tax on self-employment income is allowed for in the amounts credited to the trust fund, but no breakdown between the two types of old-age insurance taxes is available monthly. Estimates of the breakdown are made on a fiscal year basis beginning 1952

2/ Figures reflect adjustments pursuant to Public Law 734 (see footnote 8) as follows: suspension of current tax receipts in the amount of $113 million in October 1951, $37 million in November 1951, $25 million in January 1952, and $125 million in June 1952, and additional transfer of $14 million in April 1952.

10/ Excludes interest on refunds, which is included in "Miscellaneous expenditures".

Note: This table presents a recapitulation by months, with calendar year as well as fiscal year totals, of budget expenditures under the classifications shown in Tables 2 through 5. Expenditure figures as originally published for earlier years have been reclassified and revised where necessary so as to place each series on a comparable basis for the whole period shown. It is planned to publish a similar recapitulation from time to time in order to bring the information up to date in convenient form for reference. The corresponding data on total budget expenditures are published each month in Table 6, which carries also an explanation of the coverage of the figures. Expenditures are "net", after allowance for reimbursements to appropriations, receipts of revolving fund appropriations, and receipts credited to disbursing accounts of corporations and agencies having authority to use collections without formal covering into the Treasury.

1/ Fiscal year ending June 30 of year indicated.

2/ Excludes those expenditures on behalf of the Department of the Air Force which have been made out of appropriations to the Department of the Army.

3/ Includes certain expenditures on behalf of the Department of the Air Force (see footnote 2). Excludes expenditures by the Department of the Army as follows: those classified separately under "National defense and related activities" and under "International finance and aid"; those for river and harbor works and flood control, which are included under "Public works"; and those for the Panama Canal. Defense expenditures for the Panama Canal prior to July 1947 are included under "Other national defense and related activities", and nondefense expenditures are included under "Miscellaneous".

4/ Excludes expenditures by the Department of the Navy classified separately under "National defense and related activities" and under "International finance and aid".

5/ After 1947, expenditures for national defense and related activities were not segregated from other expenditures of the Corporation and its affiliates, shown elsewhere in this table.

Excludes expenditures classified separately under "National defense and related activities". Beginning September 1946, includes expenditures of the War Shipping Administration, transferred to the Commission as of September 1 for liquidation by December 31, 1946, by an act approved July 8, 1946 (60 Stat. 501). Beginning July 1949, expenditures of the Commission until it was abolished are included with those of the Department of Commerce, shown elsewhere in this table (see footnote 1).

17 Prior to June 1947, expenditures for this purpose are included under 'Miscellaneous'.

8/ Through June 1947, includes "war" or "national defense" expenditure of various departments and agencies; administrative expenses of the Selective Service System; expenditures of the War Shipping Administration not included under other "national defense" classifications, until the Administration was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission for liquidation (see footnote 6); aid to China; and beginning July 1, 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. From July 1947 through February 1948, consists of expenditures of that Committee and the Selective Service System. Thereafter includes also expenditures of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, including retired pay for the military services beginning September 1949.

2/ Subscriptions to the International Monetary Fund and the capital of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Payments to the Bank were made in four equal installments and amounted to $635 million. That part of the payment to the Fund which appeared as a budget expenditure was made in February 1947 and amounted to $950 million. The balance of the United States quota for the fund, or $1,800 million, was paid from the Exchange Stabilization Fund.

Part of the payment to each institution was made in the form of noninterest-bearing notes to be redeemed as the cash was needed by the Bank and the Fund, respectively (see "Debt Outstanding", Table 1). 10/ Prior to July 1945, the net of Export-Import Bank operations is included under "Miscellaneous" expenditures.

it statutory powers in addition to those granted by its charter. 11/ A total credit of $3,750 million was authorized by the Financial Agreement of December 6, 1945, which became effective on July 15, 1946. Repayments began on December 31, 1951 (see Table 4).

1/ Excess of expenditures is covered by appropriations by Congress.
2/ Taxes on employers and employees under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and later amendments (subchapter A of chapter 9 of the Internal Revenue Code - 26 U.S.C. 1400-1432); and tax on self-employment income under the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (subchapter E of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code - 26 U.S.C. 480-482). The tax on self-employment income is levied and collected as part of the individual income tax beginning with the taxable year 1951. Beginning January 1951, the receipts shown here are based on estimates (see footnote 4).
3/ Tax on employers of 8 or more under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and later amendments (26 U.S.C. 1600-1611). Against this tax certain credits not to exceed 90 percent of the total tax are allowed with respect to contributions by the taxpayer to a State fund under a State unemployment compensation law.
4/ Appropriation to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund equivalent to the amount of taxes collected and deposited for

old-age insurance (42 U.S.C. 401 (a); see also footnote 2). The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (Public Law 734), approved August 28, 1950, changed in certain respects the basis of transferring the appropriated funds to the trust fund. Effective January 1, 1951, the amounts transferred currently as appropriations to the trust fund are based on estimates of old-age insurance tax receipts made by the Secretary of the Treasury, and are adjusted in

later transfers on the basis of wage and self-employment income records maintained by the Federal Security Administrator. For purposes of this table, beginning January 1951, the same amount as is credited each month to the trust fund is shown as estimated current tax receipts for old-age insurance.

5/ Interest on refunds is included under "Administrative expenses". For explanation of adjustments in these figures, see Table 1. 7/ Includes expenditures from appropriations made specifically for administrative expenses relating to the Social Security Act, as amended; administrative expenses reimbursed to the General Fund of the Treasury under Section 201 (f) of the Social Security Act, as amended; administrative expenses under the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, as amended (29 U.S.C. 49d); and interest on refunds of social security taxes. 8/ Aid to permanently and totally disabled (Title XIV) as added by Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 (Public Law 734), approved August 28, 1950.

2/ Security Act Amendments of 1936 (Public Law 74-77) approved August 26,1936. For unemployment insurance and maintenance of public employment offices, includes expenditures made directly by the Federal Government beginning January 1942 for maintenance of employment offices, and expenditures of the U. S. Employment Service for the period December 1942 through June 1948, when it was not in the Bureau of Employment Security.

10/ Total includes expenditures for grants to States, Public Health Service, as follows; 1945, $10.7 million; and 1946, $2 million. After 1945 expenditures were made under provisions of the Public Health Service Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 682).

UNITED STATES SAVINGS BONDS

United States savings bonds were first offered in March 1935 and began to mature in March 1945. Series A-D were sold between March 1935 and the end of April 1941, and Series E, F, and G were first offered in May 1941. When Series E began to mature on May 1, 1951, owners of the matured bonds were offered three options: To redeem the bonds in cash in accordance with the original terms; to retain them with an extended maturity of 10 years at specified rates of interest accrual; or to exchange them for Series G bonds. A number of changes became effective May 1, 1952. The principal ones were: The rate of interest accrual on Series E was increased, especially for the near term, with corresponding changes in extended Series E; and Series F and G were replaced by two new issues, Series J

and K, also at higher interest rates. A new current-income bond, Series H, similar in interest return to Series E, was offered beginning June1. For details of these changes see "Treasury Bulletin" for May 1952, page A-1.

In the tables which follow, Series A-F and J sales are shown at issue price and total redemptions and amounts outstanding at current redemption values. Series G, H, and K are shown at face value throughout. Matured bonds which have been redeemed are included in redemptions. Data by denominations and sales by States are published on a monthly basis but not in each issue of the "Treasury Bulletin".

Notes: Treasury bonds included in the averages, beginning April 1952, are those neither due nor callable for twelve years. The minimum length of the bonds included was 15 years from December 1935 through March 1952, and 12 years prior to December 1935 for the period shown in this table. For a discussion of the composition of these Treasury bond averages, see "Treasury Bulletin" for March 1944, page 58; for the composition of the high-grade corporate bond average, see the "Treasury Bulletin" for July 1947, page 59, and January 1945, page 56. Treasury bond yields are computed on the basis of the mean of closing bid and ask quotations in the over-the-counter market as reported to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, beginning September 2, 1941. Prior to that time, yields were computed on the basis of closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange, except that on days when an issue did not sell the yield was computed on the mean of closing bid and ask quotations on the Exchange. Corporate bond yields are computed on the basis of closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange and the New York Curb Exchange; on days when an issue

1/ For definition of taxable and partially tax-exempt bonds, see foot-notes to the "Treasury Survey of Ownership" in this issue of the "Treasury Bulletin".

Source: Daily Treasury Statement for total receipts from internal revenue; reports by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for collections by type of tax. Detail by type of tax is available only on a collection basis. Receipts on the Daily Treasury Statement basis are compiled from the latest daily reports from Government depositaries; they do not coincide with amounts reported by the Bureau because of the lag in deposits of collections and because certain taxes are paid directly into the depositaries.
1/ Excludes collections for credit to certain trust accounts for island possessions; includes corporation income tax on Alaska Railroad (repealed by Public Law 386, approved June 10, 1952, for taxable years ending after that date).
2/ Includes excess profits taxes formerly shown separately as follows: unjust enrichment through 1947 (thereafter these collections are included under "Miscellaneous taxes"); declared value (repealed for years ending after June 30, 1946); Excess Profite Tax Act of 1940

(Title II of the Second Revenue Act of 1940, which was repealed for years ending after December 31, 1945). Includes also excess profit taxes on Army and Navy contracts under the Vinson Act as amended (34 U.S.C. 496) and income tax on business income of exempt organizations, imposed by the Revenue Act of 1951, approved October 20, 1951. 3/Monthly figures include old-age insurance tax on self-employment income, which is levied and collected as part of the individual income tax beginning with the taxable year 1951. Fiscal year figures exclude this tax, on the basis of estimates beginning 1952, and it is included under "old-age insurance taxes". 4/Withheld income tax and old-age insurance taxes on employers and employees are paid into the Treasury in combined amounts beginning January 1951, and so current collections are not separable as to type of tax. For fiscal years beginning 1951, the breakdown is estimated. 5/Repealed for years ending after June 30, 1945. Beginning July 1950, included under "Miscellaneous taxes".

CAPITAL MOVEMENTS

Data relating to claims on foreigners and liabilities to foreigners, and capital movements between the United States and foreign countries, have been collected since 1935, pursuant to Executive Order 6560 of January 15, 1934, and Treasury regulations thereunder. Information covering the principal types of data and the principal countries is reported each month by banks and bankers and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. This information is published regularly in the "Treasury Bulletin". Supplementary information is published at less frequent intervals. All reports are made initially to the Federal Reserve Banks, which forward consolidated figures to the Treasury.

The term "foreigners" as used in these reports covers all institutions and individuals (including United States citizens) domiciled outside the United States, as well as international organizations, wherever domiciled, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states. "Short-term" refers to original maturities of one year or less, and "long-term" refers to all other maturities. A detailed discussion of the reporting coverage, basis of reporting, and derivation of capital movements figures appeared in the April 1950 issue of the "Treasury Bulletin", pages 50-52. Revised report forms and regulations became effective with

the data for January 1950. Attention is called to the fact that although the grand total figures on the revised reporting basis are reasonably comparable with those for preceding months, data for individual countries in some instances are not comparable because of certain changes in coverage and geographical classification.

The supplementary information, contained in Section IV, is presented in three tables appearing at different times. Table 1 gives data by countries on short-term claims on and liabilities to foreigners as reported quarterly by exporters, importers, and industrial and commercial concerns in the United States. This information was published for the first time in the October 1949 issue of the "Treasury Bulletin" and begins with data for September 30, 1946. Table 2 supplies information by countries on long-term claims on and liabilities to foreigners as reported by banks and bankers in the United States. This table appeared for the first time in the December 1949 issue. Data are for the end of the calendar year beginning with 1942. Table 3 gives information on short-term liabilities to countries not regularly reported separately by banks and bankers. This table appeared for the first time in the April 1950 issue. The data have been requested at irregular intervals, the earliest date being October 1943.
