Treasury Financing Operations

February Certificate Maturity

A one-year issue of 7/8 percent certificates of indebtedness, outstanding in the amount of $3,947 million, matured on February 1, 1948. On January 20, 1948, the Secretary of the Treasury announced the offering of a new one-year 1-1/8 percent certificate in exchange, par for par, for the maturing certificates. Cash subscriptions were not received. The new certificates are dated February 1, 1948, and bear interest from that date at the rate of 1-1/8 percent per annum. Interest will be paid in full with the principal on the maturity date, February 1, 1949. The certificates of indebtedness were issued in bearer form only, in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $100,000, and $1,000,000.

Reports to the Treasury on the ownership of Government securities indicate that on December 31, 1947, about 70 percent of the $3,947 million of certificates maturing February 1 were owned by reporting commercial banks and Federal Reserve Banks. The ownership figures for December 31 are the latest which are available for holdings of both commercial banks and Federal Reserve Banks.

Note: Historical details of Treasury market financing operations are shown in the tables on "Offerings" and "Disposition", respectively, of marketable issues of

Subscription books were opened on January 20 and closed at the close of business January 22. Holdings of the maturing certificates of indebtedness by the Federal Reserve Banks, which amounted to $1,614 million on January 30, were redeemed in full for cash. Exchange subscriptions for the new issue amounted to $2,189 million, leaving $143 million to be paid in cash to holders other than Federal Reserve Banks.

Treasury Bills Refunded and Retired

Reductions in Treasury bills outstanding again took place in January. The five issues maturing during the month totaled $5.9 billion and the total refunded was $5.6 billion. The first two maturities were $1.3 billion each and the last three $1.1 billion each. The first two maturing issues were refunded in full, but each of the last three was reduced by $100 million. Bill retirements from April 17, 1947, when the first bill reduction occurred, through January 29, 1948, have totaled $2.2 billion. The average rates of discount for the five January offerings, beginning with that dated January 2, were 0.953 percent, 0.950 percent, 0.976 percent, 0.981 percent, and 0.990 percent, respectively.

UNITED STATES SAVINGS BONDS

United States savings bonds were first offered for sale in March 1975. Series A-D were sold from March 1975 to April 1941. Series E, F, and G bonds have been on sale since May 1, 1941. For information on the terms and conditions of these bonds, see "Treasury Bulletin" issues for December 1947, page 31, and October 1935, pages A-4 and A-5. Sales and redemptions data by States are published at the end of each calendar and each fiscal year after June 30, 1947. Sales by denominations are also published semi-annually after December 31, 1947.

In the following tables sales figures are quoted at issue price, and redemptions and amounts outstanding at current redemption values. Amounts of Series G outstanding are quoted at par. Matured bonds which have been redeemed are included in the figures on redemptions. Matured bonds outstanding are reflected in the interest-bearing debt until all bonds of the series have matured, when they are transferred to matured debt upon which interest has ceased.

Source: Daily Treasury Statement; Office of the Treasurer of the U. S. 1/ Beginning with June 1947, Series E sales include small amounts of unclassified sales consisting of Series X, Y, and O. These amounts are substantially less than the sales reported as unclassified in the Daily Treasury Statement. The greater part of that item consists of sales for which information is available as to the series but not the year of issue. On the basis of that information such sales are included in this table according to series. Prior to

June 1947, it was possible to distribute by series all sales reported as unclassified in the Daily Treasury Statement. 2/ Series F redemptions include small amounts of unclassified Series A-D redemptions beginning with October 1948, and small amounts also of unclassified Y and O redemptions, beginning with June 1947. 3/ Not calculated for matured series.

TREASURY SAVINGS NOTES

Treasury savings notes have been issued in three series: Series A from August 1, 1941, through June 22, 1943; Series B from August 1, 1941, through September 12, 1942; and Series C on continuous sale since September 14, 1942. For details concerning terms and conditions, investment yields, and tax payment or redemption values of Series C notes, see "Treasury Bulletin" for October 1945, pages A-4 and A-5. For similar information regarding Series A and B notes, see "Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury" for 1942, pages 207 and 220. For sales and redemptions of Series A and B notes by fiscal years

and months, see "Treasury Bulletin" for February 1946, pages 42 and 43.

In the following tables sales and redemptions of Treasury savings notes are shown at par value. Matured notes redeemed (either for cash or for tax payment) are included in the figures on redemptions. Matured notes outstanding are reflected in the interest-bearing debt until all notes of the series have matured, when they are transferred to matured debt upon which interest has ceased, in accordance with the practice of the Daily Treasury Statement.

Treasury Bulletin

TREASURY SURVEY OF OWNERSHIP, DECEMBER 31, 1947

The Treasury Survey of Ownership covers securities issued by the United States Government and by Federal agencies. The banks and insurance companies included in the Survey account for approximately 95 percent of such securities held by all banks and insurance companies in the United States.

Information on the distribution of ownership by types of banks and insurance companies is published each month. Additional information showing the holdings of commercial banks distributed according to Federal Reserve member-bank classes and nonmember banks has been published at less frequent intervals.

this information is published for June 30 and December 31. Figures for December 31, 1947, will appear in the April issue of the 'Treasury Bulletin'.

The Survey began with data for March 31, 1941, which appeared in the "Treasury Bulletin" for May of that year. Revisions of data on insurance companies for May 31, 1943, and prior months appeared in the November 1943 issue; reclassification of data on banks for the period November 30, 1943, through February 29, 1944, appeared in the May 1944 issue; and revisions of data for September 30, 1944, appeared in the February 1945 issue.

Note: The Treasury bond yield averages include only bonds which are neither due nor callable for fifteen years. For a discussion of the composition of these averages, see the "Treasury Bulletin" for March 1944, page 58; for the composition of the high-grade corporate bond average, see the "Treasury Bulletin" for July 1947, page 59, and January 1945, page 56. Treasury bond yields are computed on the basis of the mean of closing bid and ask quotations in the over-the-counter market, beginning September 2, 1941. Prior to that time, yields were computed on the basis of closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange, except that on days when an issue did not sell the yield was computed on the mean of closing bid and ask quotations on the Exchange. Corporate bond yields are computed on the basis of closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange and the

New York Curb Exchange; on days when an issue does not sell, the price of the last preceding sale is need.
1/ For definition of taxable and partially tax-exempt bonds, see foot-notes to the "Treasury Survey of Ownership" in this issue of the "Treasury Bulletin". The partially tax-exempt series was discontinued on December 15, 1945, because there were no longer any bonds in this category with fifteen or more years to maturity or first call.
2/ Average revised beginning November 1, 1944. Old average for November 1944 was 2.56%.
3/ Average revised beginning April 1, 1947. Old average for April 1947 was 2.47%.
4/ Market closed.

CAPITAL MOVEMENTS

Information relating to capital movements between the United States and foreign countries is presented in four sections. Section I contains the principal types of data on capital movements by years from 1935, and currently by months. Each type of data is then broken down into its chief components in the same chronological detail.

Section II supplies a geographic breakdown by principal countries for recent months. The total capital movements are given first and then the principal categories are shown separately. In addition, at this point, the total outstanding claims on and liabilities to foreign countries are each presented.

Details with respect to capital movements and short-term claims and liabilities are presented in Section III as of the latest month for which the data are available.

Section IV contains data for recent months on the

net position in foreign currencies of banks and brokers in the United States, their outstanding foreign exchange contracts, and purchases and sales of foreign exchange, both spot and forward.

These data relating to capital movements are based on reports filed each month by banks, bankers, and brokers throughout the United States. The reports are collected, checked and tabulated by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. The totals are then forwarded to the Treasury Department for consolidation and publication.

Figures for previous periods may be obtained from the following sources: "Treasury Bulletin", November 1945, for a summary of capital movements, and position in foreign currencies by months, 1942-1945. Supplement to "Treasury Bulletin", November 1945, on "Capital Movements between the United States and Foreign Countries, January 1942 through April 1945", for details during that period. "Treasury Bulletin", March 1942, and earlier issues, for details covering years back to January 2, 1935.
