Profile of the Economy

[Source: Office of Macro economic Analysis]

Real gross domestic product (GDP)

In the first quarter of 2000, real GDP in creased at a 5.4 per- cent an nual rate. This was be low the out sized 7.3 per cent in crease in the fourth quarter of 1999, but it exceeded the av er age quarterly gain of 4.4 per cent during the last 4 years. The slow down re flected de terioration in net ex ports as well as a fallback in in ven tory in vest ment and in Fed eral spend ing. The lat ter two cate gories grew very rap idly in the fourth quar ter of 1999 in an tic ipation of pos si ble dis rupt ions re lat ing to the Year 2000 (Y2K) bug.

Although overall GDP growth slowed, domestic purchases other than in inventory investment were extraordinarily strong in the first quarter of 2000. Domestic final demand accelerated to an 8.0 per cent annual rate from 5.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999. Personal consumption expenditures surged at an 8.3 per cent pace, the fastest quarterly rate since early 1983. Growth in consumer spending picked up markedly in the last 3 years, fueled by rising income and by the wealth effects of stock market gains. Business fixed investment also strengthened in the first quarter of 2000. It rebounded at a 21.2 per cent pace after growing just 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999. Deferred purchases of computer equipment until after the Y2K date change partly contributed to the investment swing.

The grow ing for eign trade def i cit con tin ued to drag on the economy in the first quar ter of 2000, sub tract ing 1.3 per cent age points from real growth. This was more than in recent quar ters but less than the drag in the first quar ter of 1999.

The national ac counts mea sures of in flation ac celer ated in the first quarter of 2000, mainly reflecting higher energy prices. The GDP price in dex moved up at a 2.7 per cent an nual rate com pared with 2.0 per cent in the fourth quar ter of 1999. However, after ex clud ing food and en ergy, the core rate in- creased just 2.1 per cent. This was less than the 2.2 per cent rate in the pre vi ous quarter.

(Percent change, fourth quarter to fourth quarter)

Inflation

Inflation has picked up this year. Energy prices have increased sharply and are responsive for much of the acceleration. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, still remains relatively moderate. Rising compensation costs are causing some concern, but continued productivity growth should help minimize the passthrough to prices.

Consumer prices increased at a 4.3 per cent annual rate during the first 4 months of 2000. This was an acceleration of about 1-1/2 percentage points from 1999. Higher oil prices greatly contributed to the rise. Prices of petroleum-based energy products have risen at an annual rate of more than 50 per cent after jumping by almost 30 per cent in 1999. Core inflation accelerated to a 2.9 per cent annual rate. That was up one percentage point from the 1.9- per cent rise in 1999, the smallest yearly increase since 1965. Food prices rose at a modest 1.5 percent pace in 2000.

At the producer level, the pattern for finished goods prices generally mirrored developments at the consumer level. Finished goods prices rose at a 5.4 percent pace in the first 4

months of 2000, up from 2.9 per cent in 1999. Core in flation remains moderate, in creasing at a 1.2 per cent annual rate. This follows a 0.9 per cent rise in 1999. The increase in energy prices has accelerated from a little more than 18 per cent in 1999 to just under 25 per cent in 2000. Further back in the production chain, core prices for crude goods are rising at a slower rate than in 1999, but prices for core intermediate goods picked up.

Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector increased at a 4.2 per cent annual rate in the first quarter, little different from the 4.3 percent rise recorded for all of 1999. Productivity growth slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2000 after a huge 6.9 per cent jump in the fourth quarter of 1999. This boosted the increase last year to 3.7 per cent. As a result, unit labor costs moved up at a 1.8 per cent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000 after increasing by a slight 0.6 percent in 1999. The employment cost index for total compensation, a separate but closely watched compensation measure, jumped by 1.4 per cent in the first quarter, an annual rate of 5.4 per cent. Benefit costs rose sharply.

Employment and unemployment

La bor mar kets con tinue to grow at a brisk pace dur ing the first 4 months of 2000. The un em ploy ment rate fell be low 4 per cent for the first time in 30 years, but so far there is only mod est ev i dence that wage pressure might be de vel op ing.

In recent months, the temporary hiring of employees to conduct the 2000 decennial census distorted the reported total nonfarm payroll employment growth. Excluding temporary census workers from the total nonfarm job increases of 458,000 in March and 340,000 in April would have trimmed the totals to 341,000 and 267,000, respectively. These are still

very strong re sults. So far in 2000, monthly job growth has averaged 243,000, after adjustment for census workers. This was slightly stronger than the 226,000 averaged during all of 1999. Job gains picked up in construction, which was helped by favorable weather early in 2000. Employment has been stable in manufacturing and increased in mining after declines for both in 1999. The large private service-producing sector had more temperate increases this year than last. Monthly gains averaged 185,000 during the first 4 months of 2000, down from 203,000 averaged during all of 1999. None the less, this still represents the largest source of job growth.

The economy continues to operate at a very high rate of labor utilization. Unemployment declined from 4.1 percent of the labor force in February and March to 3.9 per cent in April. This was the lowest rate since the same reading in January 1970. The share of the working-age population employed reached a record-breaking 64.9 per cent in April.

Wage gains in nominal terms have remained surprisingly low. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings of production and other nonsupervisory workers advanced by only

3.8 percent. This represents a slowing from a 12-month increase of 4.4 per cent 2 years ago, an unusual development in a period of tight labor markets. Growth during the first 4 months of 2000 picked up to a 4.5 per cent annual rate. This trend could be the first hint of acceleration, although developments over such a short period are seldom conclusive. In real terms, earnings rose by about 1/2 percent during 1999, extending the prior 5 years' positive readings for the strongest performance since the early 1970s.

Real disposable personal income and consumer spending

Personal income rose at a 6.3 percent annual rate in nominal terms in the first quarter of 2000. This extends the 6 per cent growth pace for the prior 4 years. Wages and salaries (the largest source of personal income) rose at a sharp 7.7 per cent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 6.5 per cent during all of 1999. Income from dividends and interest also strengthened somewhat relative to 1999. While nominal income growth remained reasonably stable, growth of real disposable (after-tax) personal income slowed in the first quarter to 3.2 percent at an annual rate from 3.7 percent in 1999. The slowdown reflected higher inflation in items purchased by consumers in the first quarter, mainly resulting from faster growth in oil prices.

Real consumer spending surged at an 8.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000, the largest quarterly increase since 1983. The biggest gains continued to center in areas of discretionary spending, such as motor vehicles, furniture and appliances, recreational services, and clothing. Information on retail sales in April suggests that spending flat tened out some early in the second quarter of 2000 after the outsized gain of the first quarter.

The greater in crease in spend ing than in dis pos able in come pulled the per sonal sav ing rate down fur ther to only 0.7 per cent in the first quar ter of 2000 from 1.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999. The latest read ing is the lowest since neg ative saving was recorded in 1933. The saving rate has declined steadily from a re cent high of 8.7 per cent in 1992, pri mar ily because of the grow ing “wealth ef fect” re sult ing from the stock mar ket rise. In creases in as set val ues are not counted as income in the national income and product accounts, from which saving is calculated, but none the less contri bute to the will ing ness of con sum ers to spend.

Industrial production and capacity utilization

Industrial production in manufacturing, mining and utilities continues to pick up in 2000. During the first 4 months of 2000, production rose at a strong 7.9 percent annual rate.

repreents a sharp improvement from 4.7 per cent over the 12 months of 1999 and only 2.5 per cent during 1998, when the effects of the Asian crisis curtailed activity.

Manufacturing production, which accounts for 88 percent of total industrial output, has increased at an 8.3 per cent annual rate so far in 2000 compared to a gain of 5.2 per cent during all of 1999. The high-tech industries of computers, semiconductors and communications equipment continue to buoy growth, with an annual rate gain approaching 60 per cent this year. Excluding the high-tech category, factory output is advancing at only a 2.8 per cent rate so far during 2000, but that is still stronger than the 1.6 per cent rise during all of 1999. Production in the mining industry try (5-1/2 per cent of industrial output) has risen at a 3.7 per cent pace in 2000, compared to 1.4 per cent in 1999. Output in mining had plunged by 7.0 percent during 1998, when falling oil prices resulted in sharply reduced activity in oil and gas extraction.

The combination of substantial production gains and slower capacity building resulted in a higher rate of industrial capacity utilization in 2000. In April, the utilization rate reached 82.1 per cent. This was slightly above the long-run average of 82.0 per cent and the highest level since May 1998. Despite a 1.7 percentage point advance over 1999, this rate still remains 2.3 percentage points below its expansion high of 84.4 percent reached in January 1995.

Nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs

There has been growth in recognition that U.S. productivity growth has moved to a higher trend rate in recent years, the result of innovations and investment in information technology. Nonfarm business productivity (real output per hour worked) has risen at a 2.8 per cent annual rate since the end of 1995. That was double the rate averaged over the previous two decades. During 1999, nonfarm productivity grew by a particularly strong 3.6 per cent, including gains at nearly a 6.0 per cent pace during the final two quarters. In the first quarter of 2000, growth moderated to a still strong 2.4 per cent annual rate.

Hourly compensation costs in the nonfarmbusiness sector rose at a 4.2 per cent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000, about the same as averaged in 1999. Unit labor costs, which reflect the interaction of compensation and productivity,

PRO FILE OF THE ECON OMY

in creased at a 1.8 per cent an nual rate in the first quar ter after rising by a nar row 0.6 per cent during all of 1999. Re cent very low growth rates in unit la bor costs have been im por tant in help ing to con tain in fla tion and hold growth of prices of U.S. out put to only 1.8 per cent over 1999.

Productivity in the manufacturing sector continued to register impressive gains. Factory output per hour soared at a 6.9 per cent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000. This matched the strong rate of increase during all of 1999. Hourly compensation costs in manufacturing rose at a 3.8 per cent pace in the first quarter. Because the increase in compensation was more than offset by rapid productivity growth, unit labor costs in manufacturing fell at a 2.9 per cent pace in the first quarter. The drop extended a 6-year declining trend, reducing factory unit labor costs by a total of 8.7 per cent.

Current account balance

The current account measures international trade in goods and services as well as the net flow of investment income and net unilateral transfers. The current account has been in deficit almost continuously since the early 1980s. In 1999, the current account deficit reached a record $338.9 billion, representing an all-time high 3.7 percent share of nominal GDP

The deficit widened substantially during the 1990s primarily because of deterioration in the merchandise trade balance. U.S. economic growth outpaced that of its major trading partners, causing imports to grow much more rapidly than exports. Sharp dollar appreciation from 1995 to 1998 and higher prices for imported oil since 1999 contributed to the widening trade gap. The merchandise trade deficit doubled in the last 5 years to $347.1 billion in 1999, a record high. It continued to increase in the first quarter of 2000.

Other major components of the current account contributed to the growing deficit. The surplus on trade in services narrowed in the last 2 years. In addition, what had been a positive

balance on investment income shifted to a negative in 1998 and 1999. Large inflows of capital into the United States boosted payments of earnings and interest to foreigners.

The current account deficit is matched by offsetting transactions in the financial and capital accounts, plus a statistical discrepancy. The financial account recorded a net inflow of $378.2 billion in 1999 as in flows for foreign-owned as sets in the United States far exceeded outflows for U.S.-owned as sets abroad. Net inflows of foreign direct investment and of private securities, including equities, jumped sharply.

Exchange rate of the dollar

Since 1995, the ex change rate of the dol lar against a broad index of important U.S. trading partners' currencies increased mark edly as eco nomic growth in this coun try out paced that of most of the U.S.'s trading part ners. After some vol a til ity in 1998, the ex change rate leveled out in 1999 be fore rising again since Oc to ber. The dol lar appre ciated by 1.9 percent from Oc- to ber through April against the broad in dex of cur ren cies.

All of the appreciation was against the major currencies of the most important U.S. trading partners. These currencies consist of the euro plus those of other major partners such as Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. Since October 1999, the dollar has increased by 4.8 per cent against that narrow range of major currencies. In contrast, the dollar remains relatively steady against the currencies of other important U.S. trading partners.

The performance of the dollar against the aggregate index of major currencies masks divergent patterns among individual currencies. The dollar appreciated steadily by more than 13 per cent from October through April against the euro. The exchange rate against the yen was more volatile. Since its most recent peak in August 1998, the exchange rate of the dollar against the yen fell by almost 30 per cent through December 1999, then improved by 3 per cent from December through April. The yen strengthened in 1999 amid expectations that a recovery in the Japanese economy was imminent. In addition, strong foreign interest in Japanese equities helped augment the yen's rise.

Interest rates

The Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy because of concern that the faster growth in demand than in potential supply could result in inflation. In 1999, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates three times by a total of 75 basis points. This reversed the easing moves made in 1998 during the period of global financial turmoil. So far in 2000, the Federal Reserve increased rates three more times by a total of 100 basis points (1 per cent age point). The six increases raised the key Federal funds target rate (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans) from 4.75 per cent to 6.50 per cent.

The dis count rate (the rate the Fed eral Re serve charges banks for short-term funds) was raised from 4.50 per cent to 6.0 per-cent. The mar ket in ter est rate for the 3-month Trea sury bill, which usu ally cen ters on the level of the dis count rate, was about 6.2 per cent in mid-May.

Rates on long-term Treasury securities increased through 1999 and in early 2000 as economic growth continued to expand at a rapid pace. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury note rose from about 4.7 per cent at the end of 1998 to over 6.6 per cent in early 2000. The rate on the 30-year Treasury bond rose from 5.1 per cent to 6.6 per cent over that period. In 2000,

long-term yields eased as the price of securities rose. The higher prices largely reflected concern that buybacks and reduced new long-term debt is sure by the Treasury because of growing budget surpluses would shrink the Treasury securities supply. In May, yields moved up again.

(Percent)

Mortgage interest rates, which follow the pattern of the interest rate on the 10-year Trea sury note, also have in creased since 1998. The in ter est rate on a con ven tional 30-year fixed rate loan rose from a 30-year low of 6.7 per cent in Oc to ber 1998 to 8.2 per cent in April 2000. Ris ing mort gage in ter est rates have dampened housing activity.

Long-term Interest Rates

(Percennt)

Housing

Activity in the housing market has slowed a bit because of rising mortgage interest rates, but it remains at a fairly high level. Rapid gains in employment and income and the wealth effects of rising stock prices have continued to support strong demand for housing despite the increase in mortgage costs.

Sales of new sin gle-family homes posted a new re cord of 904,000 in 1999. This was only about 2 per cent higher than in 1998 when new home sales rose by al most 10 per cent. Re sales of ex ist ing homes also reached a new re cord in 1999, climbing 4.5 percent above the 1998 total to 5.2 million. New home sales ac cel er ated in the first quar ter of 2000, partly due to un- seasonably mild weather.

Growth in sales of both new and ex ist ing homes over the past several years has led to a dramatic in crease in home ownership Since the be gin ning of 1993, the num ber of new home own ers has grown by al most 9 mil lion. The homeownership rate rose to 67.1 percent in the first quarter of 2000, an all-time re cord.

Con struc tion of new hous ing units moved up to 1.67 mil lion in 1999. This was the high est an nual to tal since 1986. Starts of single-family homes rose by 5 per cent to a 21-year peak, while starts of multi-family units declined slightly. Total housing starts rose fur ther in the first quar ter of 2000 to an an nual rate

of 1.73 mil lion. All of that in crease was for multi-family con-struction. Starts of new sin gle-family homes eased slightly af-ter a large jump in the fourth quar ter of 1999. Strength in to tal housing starts in 1999 and 2000 trans lated into large in creases in real residen tial in vestment.

Federal budget

The Federal budget is expected to show a much larger surplus in fiscal 2000 than the $167 billion projected in the Administration’s “Fiscal Year 2001 Budget” (released in February). Fiscal 2000 will mark the third consecutive year of Federal budget surplus after 28 years of deficits. The surplus grew to $124 billion in fiscal 1999 from $69 billion in fiscal 1998. Strong economic growth and passage of deficit reduction programs placed the deficit on a downward course after it reached an all-time high of $290 billion in fiscal 1992. The surpluses are estimated to reduce the amount of Federal debt held by the public by a total of $355 billion by the end of fiscal 2000.

Since 1992, growth in Federal outlays has remained restrained while strong growth in jobs, in come and cap i tal gains has boosted re ceipts. Out lays in creased just 3.0 per cent in fis- cal 1999 and dipped to 18.7 per cent in re la tion to GDP, the

PRO FILE OF THE ECON OMY

low est rate in 25 years. Out lays are ex pected to grow some-what faster in fis cal 2000 than last year but by much less than re ceipts. Re ceipts were pro jected to rise by about 7.0 per cent this year com pared with 6.1 per cent in fis cal 1999, but so far the pace has risen even higher. Im prove ment in corpo rate prof-its and strong in creases in in di vid ual in come and cap i tal gains have driven the ac cel er a tion in tax re ceipts this fis cal year.

The “Fiscal Year 2001 Budget” fore casted that surpluses will continue. By directing the surpluses to ward continued debt reduction, firm ing the long-run sol vency of Social Se curity and Medicare, and making in vest ments to enhance the eco nomic ex pan sion, the $3.6 trillion debt held by the public at the end of fiscal 1999 could be com pletely paid off by 2013.

Net national saving and investment

Net national saving averaged 7.3 percent of net national product(NNP) in 1999, slightly below the 7.6 percent for all of 1998. (Net saving and NNP excluded depreciation to replace wornout or obsolete equipment, software and structures used in production.) The saving rate for 1999 is still nearly double the 3.9 percent reached in 1993, the lowest rate for any year since the 1930s. Net National Saving (Saving as a percent of NNP) 15

The swing in the Federal budget from large deficits into surplus has more than accounted for the improvement. As a result, the public sector moved from dissaving equivalent to 4.7 percent of NNP in 1993 (and an even larger 5.4 per cent in 1992) to saving of 2.1 per cent in 1999. Despite the progress, net saving still remains well below the 11.6 per cent of NNP averaged in the 1950s and 1960s.

Net National Saving

(Saving as a percent of NNP)

Private saving declined from a record high of 9.4 per cent of NNP in 1992 to 5.2 per cent in 1999. A sharp fall in saving by households has more than offset a gain in corporate saving. Increased wealth generated by a surging stock market is an important factor in the reduced desire of households to save out of current income. In 1999, personal saving was equivalent to only 1.9 per cent of NNP, down from 7.4 percent in 1992. Growth of corporate profits, on the other hand, lifted net corporate saving from 2.2 per cent of NNP in 1992 to 3.3 percent in 1999.

Net domestic investment (by government and private industry in structures, equipment, software and inventory) increased from a very low 5.2 per cent of NNP in 1991 to 9.7 percent in 1999. A large portion of this investment was financed from abroad, as U.S. net foreign investment swung from 0.3 per cent of NNP in 1991 to -3.9 per cent in 1999.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usually takes the form of appropriations that allow obligations to be incurred and payments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have expired or would otherwise expire. These are counted as new budget authority in the fiscal year of the legislation in which the reappropriation act is included, regardless of when the amounts were originally appropriated or when they would otherwise lapse.

Obligations generally are liquidated by the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash—outlays. Obligations may also be liquidated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned-income tax credit its in excess of tax liability ties are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, there fore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts. Total Government receipts are compared with total outlays in calculating the budget surplus or deficit.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipt accounts). The former normally can be used without appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements to appropriations. For accounting purposes, earned reimbursements are also known as revenues. These offsetting collections are netted against gross outlays in determining net outlays from such appropriations; and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental and trust); offsetting collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into three categories: (1) proprietary receipts, or collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function; (2) intragovernmental transactions, or payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts.

They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts; and (3) offsetting governmental receipts which include foreign cash contributions.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions—payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Off setting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and outlays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept set forth in the "Report of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts" as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1969. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government's fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them out of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Postal Service.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit or dianrily are not subject to targets set by the Congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (2 United States Code 900-922)] included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused on both on- and off-budget receipts, outlays and deficit of the Government.

Tables FFO-1, FFO-2 and FFO-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, es ti mates for 2 years, de tail for 13 months, and fis cal year-to-date data. They pro vide a sum mary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal entities and dis bu rs ing of fi cers, and daily re ports from the FRBs. They also de tail ac count ing trans ac tions af fect ing re ceipts and out lays of the Gov ern ment and off-budget Federal en ti ties and their re lated ef fect on as sets and li a bil i ties of the Government.

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FFO-2 in cludes on- and off-budget re ceipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FFO-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FFO-4 sum marizes on- and off-budget receipts by source and outlays by function as reported to each major fund group classification for the current fiscal year to date and prior fiscal year to date.

Table FF0-5 summarizes internal revenue receipts by regions and districts and by type of tax. Amounts reported are elections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), payments made with tax returns and subsequent payments made after tax returns are due are filed (that is, payments with delinquent returns or on-deadline accounts).

Amounts are reported based on the primary filing address provided by each taxpayer or reporting entity. For multistate corporations, the address may reflect only the district where such corporation is reported its taxes from a principal office rather than other districts where income was earned or where individual income and Social Security taxes were withheld.

Second-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 supplements fiscal data reported in the March issue of the "Treasury Bulletin." At the time of that issue's release, not enough data were available to adequately collect for the quarter.

Individual income taxes—Individual income tax receipts, net of re funds, were $201.8 bil lion for the sec ond quarter of fis cal 2000. This is an in crease of $8.7 bil lion over the com par able prior year quarter. With held re ceipts in creased by $19.8 bil lion and non-withheld re ceipts in creased by $5.6 bil lion dur ing this pe riod. Re funds in creased by $16.7 bil lion over the com par able fis cal 1999 quar ter. There was an in crease of $0.5 bil lion in ac counting adjustments between individual income tax receipts and the So cial Se cu rity and Medi care trust funds over the com parable quarter in fis cal 1999.
Corporation income taxes—Net cor po rate in come tax re-

ceipts were $31.4 bil lion for the sec ond quar ter of fis cal 2000. This is an in crease of $6.5 bil lion com pared to the prior year sec ond quar ter. The $6.5 bil lion change is com prised of an in crease of $5.6 bil lion in es ti mated and fi nal pay ments, and a de crease of $0.9 bil lion in cor po rate re funds.
Employment taxes and contributions—Employment

taxes and contributions receipts for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 were $159.2 billion, an increase of $13.2 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Federal Disability Insurance, and Federal Hospital Insurance trust funds changed by $7.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $3.0 billion respectively. There was a -$0.2 billion accounting adjustment for prior years employment tax liabilities made in the second quarter of fiscal 2000, while there was a $0.3 billion adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.

Unemployment insurance—Unemployment insurance receipts, net of refunds, for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 were $3.9 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion over the comparable quarter of fiscal 1999. Net State taxes deposited in the U.S. Treasury increased by $0.2 billion to $2.8 billion. Net Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes did not change significantly from $1.1 billion.

Contributions for other in sur ance and re fire ment—Contributions for other retirement were $1.2 bil lion for the second quarter of fiscal 2000, an increase of $0.1 billion over receipts from the comparable quarter of fiscal 1999.

The growth in contributions will remain relatively flat over the next few years as the number of employees covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) grows slowly relative to those covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).

Excise taxes—Net excise tax receipts for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 were $16.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. To tal excise tax re funds for the quarter were $0.5 billion, not a significant change over the comparable prior year quarter.

Estate and gift taxes—Net estate and gift tax receipts were $6.3 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2000. These receipts represent an increase of $0.3 billion over the same quarter in fiscal 1999.

Customs duties—Customs duties net of refunds were $4.3 bil lion for the sec ond quarter of fis cal 2000. This is an in crease of $0.1 bil lion over the com pa ra ble prior year quar- ter.

Miscellaneous receipts—Net miscellaneous receipts for the second quarter of fiscal 2000 were $9.5 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. This change is due in part to deposits of earnings by Federal Reserve Banks in increasing by $0.6 billion.

INTRODUCTION: Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The Department of Treasury's (Treasury) operating cash is maintained in accounts with the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) and branches, as well as in tax and loan accounts in other financial institutions. Major information sources include the Daily Balance Wire received from the FRBs and branches, and electronic transfers through the Letter of Credit Payment, Fedline Payment and Fedwire Deposit Systems. As the FRB accounts are depleted, funds are called in (withdrawn) from thousands of tax and loan accounts at financial institutions throughout the country.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147, Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositories maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan investment program, depositary financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate. Financial institutions wishing to retain funds deposited into their tax and loan accounts in inter-

est-bearing obligations participate under the Note Option. The program permits Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in Note Option depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way, Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuating operations on Note Option financial institution reserves and on the economy.

Likewise, those institutions wishing to remit the funds to the Treasury account at FRBs dosounder the Remittance Option.

De posits to tax and loan ac counts oc cur as cus tom ers of fi nan cial in sti tu tions de posit tax pay ments, which the fi nan cial institutions use to purchase Government securities. In most cases, this in volves a trans fer of funds from a cus tomer's ac- count to the tax and loan ac count in the same fi nan cial in sti tu- tion. Also, Trea sury can di rect the FRBs to in vest ex cess funds in tax and loan ac counts di rectly from the Trea sury ac count at the FRBs.

INTRODUCTION:Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities is sued by other Federal agencies accounting for the rest. Tables in this section of the “Treasury Bulletin” reflect the total. Further detailed information is published in the “Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States.” Like wise, information on agency securities and on investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”

Table FD-1 sum marizes the Fed eral debt by listing public debt and agency se cu ri ties held by the public, in cluding the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agen cies, largely by the So cial Se cu rity and other Fed eral re-tire ment trust funds. The net un am or tized pre mium and dis-count also are listed by total Federal se cu ri ties, se cu ri ties held by Government ac counts and se cu ri ties held by the public. The dif ference be twe en the out stand ing face value of the Federal debt and the net un am or tized pre mium and dis count is clas si-fied as the ac crual amount. (For greater de tail on hold ings of Federal se curities by par tic u lar classes of in ves tors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type in ter est-bearing marketable and nonmarketable Treasury securities. The difference between interest-bearing and total public debt securities reflects outstanding matured Treasury securities—that is, un-deemed securities that have matured and are no longer accruing interest. Because the Federal Financing Bank is under the supervision of Treasury, its securities are held by a U.S. Government account.

Intable FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by is sues to particular funds within Government. Many of the funds in vest in par value special series nonmarketables at interest rates determined by law. Others in vest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents interest-bearing securities is sued by Government agencies. Federal agency borrowing has declined in recent years, in part because the Federal Financing Bank has provided financing to other Federal agencies. (Federal agency borrowing from Treasury is presented in the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.")

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt.

The average length hit a low of 2 years, 5 months in December 1975. The length then gradually increased until it reached a high of 6 years, 4 months in May 1991. Since then, the average length has decreased. For example, during most of 1996 the average length was at 5 years, 3 months.

In March 1971, Congress enacted a limited exception to the amount of bonds with rates greater than 4-1/4 per cent that could be held by the public. This permitted Treasury to offer securities maturing in more than 7 years at current market interest rates for the first time since 1965. In March 1976, the definition of a bond was changed to include those series ties longer than 10 years to maturity. This exception has expired since 1971, authorizing Treasury to continue to issue long-term series ties. The ceiling on Treasury bonds was repealed on November 10, 1988.

The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the FRBs.

In table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling. Changes in the non-interest-bearing debt shown in the last column reflect maturities of Treasury securities on nonbusiness days, which can be re-deemed on the next business day.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Public Debt Operations

Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each marketable security is listed in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." The information in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" pertains only to marketable Treasury securities, current bills, notes and bonds.

Table PDO-1 provides a maturity schedule of interest-bearing marketable public debt securities other than regular weekly and 52-week bills. All unmatured Treasury notes and bonds are listed in maturity order, from earliest to latest. A separate breakout is provided for the combined holdings of the Government accounts and Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs), so that the "all other investors" category includes all private holdings.

TablePDO-2 presents the results of weekly auctions of 13- and 26-week bills, as well as auctions of 52-week bills.

Treasury bills mature each Thurs day. New is sues of 13-week bills are reopening of 26-week bills. New is sues of cash management bills also are presented. High yields on accepted tenders and the dollar value of total bids are presented, with the dollar value of awards made both on a competitive and non-competitive basis.

Treasury accepts noncompetitive tenders of up to $1 million for bills and $5 million for notes and bonds in each auction of securities to encourage participation of individuals and smaller institutions.

Ta blePDO-3 lists the re sults of auc tions of market able securities, other than weekly bills, in chrono logical order over the past 2 years. In cluded are: notes and bonds from ta ble PDO-1, 52-week bills from table PDO-2, and data for cash management bills.

Ta blePDO-4in di cates the to tal amount of market able securi ties allo tted to each class of in vestor. The FRBs tally into in ves tor classes the ten ders in each auc tion of market able se cu rities other than weekly auc tions of 13- and 26-week bills.

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, notes and bonds that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. [See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.]

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and non-marketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the FRBs and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The FRBs acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated amount of public debt securities held by private investors. Information is obtained from sources such as the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies. State, local and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and foreign official and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes to the table for description of investor categories.)

INTRODUCTION: Market Yields

The tables and charts in this section present yields on Treasury marketable securities, and compare long-term yields on Treasury securities with yields on long-term corporate and municipal securities.

Table MY-1 lists Treasury market bid yields at constant maturity ties for bills, notes and bonds. The Treasury yield curve in the accompanying chart is based on current market bid quotations on the most actively traded Treasury securities as of 3:30 p.m. on the last business day of the calendar quarter.

The Treasury uses quotations obtained by the FRB of New York to de rive the yield curve, based on semi an nual interest pay ments and read at con stant ma tu rity points to de-velop a consistent data series. Yields on Treasury bills are coupon equivalent yields of bank discount rates at which Trea sury bills trade in the mar ket. The Board of Gov er nors of

the Federal Reserve System publishes the Treasury constant maturity data series in its weekly H.15 press release.

Table MY-2 shows average yields of long-term Treasury, corporate and municipal bonds. The long-term Treasury average yield is the 30-year constant maturity yield. The corporate bond average yield is developed by Treasury by calculating reoffering yields on new long-term securities maturing in at least 20 years and rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service. The municipal bond average yield prior to 1991 was compiled by Treasury. Beginning with January 1991, the average yield is the "Municipal Bond Yield Average," published by Moody's Investors Service for 20-year reoffering yields on selected Aa-rated general obligations. See the footnotes for further explanation.

INTRODUCTION: U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation

The U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation (USCC) statement informs the public of the total face value of currency and coin used as a medium of exchange that is in circulation at the end of a given accounting month. The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion deemed to be in circulation. It includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate or that may do so to a limited extent. Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various is sues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census.USCC information has been published by Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when it was incorporated into the "Treasury Bulletin." The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, various U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve Board.

INTRODUCTION: Capital Movements

Treasury collects information about the transference of financial as sets and other portfolio capital movements between the United States and foreigners and has since 1935. Commercial banks and other depository institutions, bank holding companies, securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States file capital movement reports with district FRBs. Beginning in late 1998, the Federal Reserve Board also performs services on behalf of the Treasury in support of this data collection system.

Forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultation with representatives of banks, securities firms and nonbanking enterprises. Copies of the reporting forms and instructions may be obtained from the Office of Program Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220; the International Finance Division, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551; or district FRBs.

In general, in formation is reported on po site the country or geographical area where the foreigner is located, as shown on records of reportinginstitutions. However, information may not always reflect the ultimate ownership of assets. Reporting institutions are not required to go beyond addresses shown on their records and so may not be aware of the actual country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary.

Trans actions with branches or agen cies of for eign of fi cial in stitutions, wher ever lo cated, are reported op posite the coun- try that has sovereignt y over the in stitutions. Trans actions with international and re gional or gani zations are not reported op po- site any country, but are ac counted for in re gional group ings of such or gani zations. The only excep tion is in formation pertain- ing to the Bank for In tern ational Set tle ments, which is re ported op posite "Other Europe."

Banks and other depository institutions, bank holding companies, International Banking Facilities (IBFs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States must file reports. These enterprises include the branches, agencies, subsidiaries and other affiliates in the United States of foreign banking and nonbanking firms. Those with liabilities, claims or securities transactions below specified exemption levels are exempt from reporting.

Banks and other depository institutions, and some brokers and dealers, file monthly reports covering their dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, foreigners in a number of countries. Twice a year, June 30 and December 31, they also report the same liabilities and claims items attributed to foreigners in countries not shown separately on the monthly reports. Quarterly reports are filed for liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies. The exemption level applicable to these banking reports is $15 million.

Banks and other depositary institutions, securities brokers and dealers, and other enterprises report monthly their transactions with foreigners in long-term securities. They must report

se currency transactions with foreigners if their aggregate purchases or their aggregate sales amount to at least $2 million during the covered month.

Exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions and brokers), and other nonbanking enterprises must file reports quarterly if liabilities to, or claims on, unaffiliated foreigners amount to $10 million or more at the end of the covered quarter.

Nonbanking entities also report each month their aggregate U.S. dollar-denominated deposit and certificates of deposit claims of $10 million or more on banks abroad.

The data in these tables do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and other countries. The principal exceptions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies (own foreign offices) and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) in its regular reports on the U.S. balance of payments.

Section I presents liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks and other depositary institutions, as well as brokers and dealers. Dollar liabilities are reported monthly; those denominated in foreign currencies are reported quarterly. Respondents report certain of their own liabilities and a wide range of their custody liabilities to foreigners.

Section II presents claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks and other depository institutions, brokers and dealers. Data on banks' claims held for their own account are collected monthly. In formation on claims held for their domestic customers as well as on foreign currency claims is collected on a quarterly basis only. Maturity data are reported according to time remaining to maturity. Reporting also covers certain items held by brokers and dealers in the United States.

Section III contains supplementary data on dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, countries not listed separately on the monthly reports submitted by banks, other deposits institutions, brokers and dealers in the United States. The supplementary reports are filed semiannually as of the end of June and December.

Section IV shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners of exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions and brokers), and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Information does not include accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. These are reported by business enterprises to Commerce on its direct investment forms.

ex clude claims on for eign ers held through banks in the United States.

Section V contains information on transactions with foreigners in long-term domestic and foreign securities as reported by banks, brokers and other entities in the United States. The data cover transactions executed in the United States for the accounts of foreigners and transactions executed abroad for the accounts of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. This includes transactions in newly issued securities as well as transactions in and redemptions of outstanding issues. However, the data do not include non-marketable Treasury bonds and notes shown in table IFS-3.

The geo graphical break down of the trans actions data does not necessarily reflect the domicile of the ultimate owners or the original issuers of the securities. This is because the path of a security is not tracked prior to its being purchased from, or after it is sold to, a foreigner in a re portable transaction. That is, before it enters and after it departs the reporting system, own-

er ship of a se curity may be trans ferred be tween for eign ers of dif fer ent coun tries. Such trans fers may oc cur any num ber of times and are con cealed among the net fig ures for U.S. trans actionsopposite indi vidual countries. Hence, the geo graphical break down shows only the coun try of do mi cile of the for eign buyers and sellers of se curi ties in a partic u lar round of trans ac tions.

NOTE: Current and historical data on United States transactions with foreigners in long-term securities and on the gross for eign liabilities and claims reported by banks in the United States are available on the Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system website: http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. These data may be downloaded as separate time series for each country or geographical area regularly shown in the capital movements tables. Also available on this website is a table on "Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities," showing estimated total holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes for current and recent periods. All data series on the TIC website are updated on the last business day of each month.

CHART CM-A.—U.S. Liabilities to Foreigners Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

In the first quarter of 2000, U.S. banking liabilities increased only $2 billion. In creases opposite the Caribbean financial centers ($14 billion), Eu rope ($13 billion), and the rest of the world ($6 billion) barely offset de creases in U.S. banking liabilities opposite Japan ($14 billion) and “All other Asia” ($17 billion).

U.S. banking liabilities to foreigners, excluding long-term securities, are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that nearly one-half of U.S. banking liabilities currently is reported opposite the United Kingdom and the banking centers in the Caribbean. Foreigners domiciled in the rest of Europe and in Asia hold an additional 40 percent.

U.S. banking liabilities in the mid-1990s went through a growth spurt. The annual growth rate between 1993 and 1997 averaged 10 per cent. Growth in 1998 and 1999 slowed to less than 5 per cent per year, which is more in line with the 1989 through 1992 period.

CHART CM-B.—U.S. Claims on Foreigners
Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

Claims oppose site Asia continued to fall in 1999 and now stand $75 billion be low their end-1997 level. Claims opposite site “All other countries” also fell in 1999. Can ada represented $17 bil lion of the de crease in that group. Claims op po site Eu rope, notably Switzerland, and the Carib- bean financial centers increased in 1999.

U.S. banking claims on foreigners, excluding long-term securities, are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that over three-quarters of U.S. claims currently are reported opposite the United King dom, “All other Eu rope,” and, most nota bly, the banking centers in the Caribbean. For eigners do mi ciled in Asia hold less than 10 per cent of U.S. claims, down from 20 per cent at the end of 1996.

After extremely strong growth in the mid-1990s, total U.S. banking claims on foreigners are leveling off. Annual growth peaked at 15 per cent in 1997. In 1998 and the first three quarters of 1999, claims grew at a much slower annual rate of 3 per cent. For 1999 as a whole, banking claims in creased $69 billion, or 7 per cent, because of strong growth in the fourth quarter.

The data on this page present aggregate net purchases on an annual basis for 1996 through 1999, as well as activity for the first quarter of 2000. The figures show that foreigners' annual net purchases (gross purchases minus gross sales) of U.S. securities have maintained an extremely high level since 1996.

An nual net for eign pur chases of U.S. se curi ties first sur passed $100 billion in 1993. They reached a re cord high of $388 bil lion in 1997. Since then, an nual net purchases have a ver aged about $315 bil lion. Net pur chases amounted to $141 bil lion in the first quar ter of 2000, of which $93 bil lion was re ported op po site Europe.

Over the past few years, the composition of for eigners' net purchases has changed dramatically. In the mid-1990s, the majority of foreigners' net purchases consisted of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes. Since 1997, however, foreigners increasingly have turned to other long-term securities.

Taking into ac count the stock swaps, an nual U.S. net pur chases of long-ter m fore ign securi ties have av er aged about $100 bi lion since the mid-1990s, with out much vari a tion from year to year. In 1999, net stock pur chases, in clud- ing the stock swaps, to taled about $95 bi lion, mostl y through Eu rope and Ja pan. Net bond pur chases to- taled $6 bi lion, far be low the lev- els of the mid-1990s.

CHART CM-D.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Foreign Securities by U.S. Investors *

The data on this page represents U.S. in vestors' purchases and sales of long-term foreign securities as reported to the Treasury Internal - tional Capital (TIC) reporting system. How ever, in the past 2 years, U.S. investors also have acquired a substantial amount of foreign stocks, mostly European, through mergers that involve stock swaps. Net acquisitions through stock swaps amounted to $86 billion in 1998 and $114 billion in 1999. These stock swaps are not reported under the TIC reporting system.

Taking into ac count the stock swaps, an nual U.S. net pur chases of long-term foreign securi ties have av er aged about $100 bil lion since the mid-1990s, with out much vari a tion from year to year. In 1999, net stock pur chases, in clud- ing the stock swaps, to taled about $95 bil lion, mostly through Eu rope and Ja pan. Net bond pur chases to- taled $6 bil lion, far be low the lev- els of the mid-1990s. In the first quar ter of 2000, net pur chases of for eign stocks and bonds re ported to the TIC re port ing sys tem to taled $26 billion.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

The "Treasury Bulletin" reports for eigen currency holdings of large foreign exchange market participants. These reports provide information on positions in derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange futures and options, that are increasingly used in establishing foreign exchange positions but were not covered in the old reports.

The information is based on re ports of large for eign exchange mar ket par tic i pants on hold ings of six major for eign currencies (Canadian dollar, German mark, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound ster ling and Euro) and the U.S. dol lar. For-eign cur rency po si tions in the U.S. dol lar, which have been collected since January 1999, are intended to approximate "all other" currency positions of reporting institutions. U.S.-based businesses file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, branches and agencies. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Filing is required by law (31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Reg u la tions 128, Subpart C).

Weekly and monthly reports must be filed through out the calendar year by major foreign exchange market participants, which are defined as market participants with more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (end March, June, September or December). Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and sold, for foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, for foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold. Exemptions from filing the monthly report are given to banking institutions that file the Federal Financial Institu

tion Examination Council (FFIEC) 035 report (“Monthly Consolidated Foreign Currency Report”).

A quarterly report must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange market participant that had more than $1 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any quarter the previous year (end March, June, September or December). Exemptions from filing the quarterly report are given to major nonbank market participants that file weekly and monthly reports and banking institutions that file FFIEC 035 reports.

This information is published in seven sections corresponding to each of the major currencies covered by the reports. Tables I-1 through VII-1 present the currency data reported weekly by major market participants. Tables I-2 through VII-2 present more detailed currency data of major market participants, based on monthly Treasury and FFI EC 035 reports. Tables I-3 through VII-3 present quarterly consolidated currency data reported by large market participants and FFI EC report ers that do not file weekly reports.

Principal exchanged under cross-currency interest rate swaps is reported as part of purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Such principal also was noted separately on monthly and quarterly reports through December 1998, when this practice was discontinued. The net options position, or the net delta-equivalent value of an options position, is an estimate of the relation ship between an option's value and an equivalent currency hedge. The delta equivalent value is defined as the product of the first partial derivative of an option valuation formula (with respect to the price of the underlying currency) multiplied by the notional principal of the contract.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established under the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (31 United States Code 5302), which authorized establishment of a Treasury fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose some what to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Resources of the fund include dollar balances, partially invested in U.S. Government securities, special drawing rights (SDRs), and balances of foreign currencies. Principal sources of income (+) or loss (-) for the fund are profits (+) or losses (-) on SDRs and foreign exchange, as well as interest earned on assets.

Table ESF-1 presentsthe assets, liabilities and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars or their equiv a lents based on current exchange rates computed according to the ac- crual method of accounting. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the International Monetary Fund. Gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income (+) or loss (-) account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations by quarter. Figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalent according to the accrual method. "Profit (+) or loss (-) on foreign exchange" includes realized profits or losses. "Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations"

INTRODUCTION: Financial Report of the United States Government

The following pages are excerpted from the 1999 "Financial Report of the United States Government." The report and accompanying information, prepared and published annually by the Financial Management Service, are modeled after corporate-type reports and are developed on an accrual basis of accounting.

The excerpts represent some of the most noteworthy information contained in the Financial Report. Data for the Financial Report are compiled from Federal program agency ac-

counting systems governmentwide. Trea sury also pres ents a man age ment dis cus sion and anal y sis, the cus tom ary notes to the fi nancial state ments, a sec tion on “Stew ard ship In for ma- tion” and supple men tal in for ma tion, in the complete docu- ment.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) is required by law to audit the Financial Report. GAO's report, as well as the complete Financial Report, can be easily accessed through the internet at www.fms.treas.gov/cfs.

Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Position

The statement of operations and changes in net position reports the results of Government operations. This includes revenues generated by the Government's sovereign power to tax, levy duties, and as cess fines and penal ties. The statement covers the net cost of Government operations, net of revenue earned from the sale of goods and services to the public. It also includes any adjustments and unencumbered transactions that affect the net position.

Net cost of Government operations

Net cost of Government operations is the cost of operations

re ported in the state ment of net cost, which is gross cost mi nus earned revenue.

Revenues: financing sources from non-exchange revenue

The main source of revenue for Government operations is non-exchange revenue, which consists of taxes and other revenue the Federal Government generates under its governmental powers or receives by donation.

Miscellaneous earned revenue

Miscellaneous earned revenue consists of exchange revenues from the public with virtually no associated costs. These items include revenues from specie auction, rents and royal ties on the Outer Con-tinental Shelf Lands.

Unreconciled transactions

Unrecorded transactions are adjustments made to balance the change in net position.

Net position – beginning of period

This amount is the net position reported on the prior year's Balance Sheet.

Prior period adjustments

Prior period adjustments are made to revise the beginning net position balance due to accounting principle changes and other adjustments.

Net position – end of period

This is the amount reported as net position on the current year's Balance Sheet.

Statement of Net Cost

This statement shows the net costs of Government operations for fiscal 1999, which is funded by taxation or through

Federal borrowing. The state mentre flects the costs in curred to carry out the na tional pri or i ties as de ter mined by law.

Cost is divided among major functions, which are the same as in the budget except that the allocation of costs to the functions is based on accounting standards. Thus costs are reported on an accrual basis and allocated differently than in the budget. For example, the costs of pensions and retiree health benefits are allocated among all functions that employ workers rather than a subfunction in the income security function.

A description of all functions and the components of net cost for the activities included in the function is located in the supplemental information section of the "Financial Report of the United States Government" as "Net Cost Detail."

The statement contains the following three components for each function:

The gross cost of Government operations;

The revenues earned from the public for goods and services; and

The net cost of Government operations, which is the gross cost less the revenue earned.

Gross cost

Gross cost in cludes the full cost of the func tions. These costs may be di rectly traced, as signed on a cause and ef fect ba sis or reason ably al located to the function.

Earned revenue

These are revenues that the U.S. Government has earned by providing goods and services to the public at a price.

Net cost

The net cost of Government operations is the gross cost less the earned revenues.

Balance Sheet

This statement shows the operating as sets of the Government that were acquired under fiscal 1999, and prior year budgets. These assets remain available as resources to supply Government goods and services in the future. The statement also shows the Government's operating liabilities including debt held by the public.

It includes some liabilities that have not yet been funded by appropriations. The net position shown in the statement reflects operating assets less liabilities.
