Profile of the Economy

[Source: Office of Macroeconomic Analysis]

Real gross domestic product (GDP)

After rising at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2003, the fastest in almost 20 years, real gross domestic product (GDP) continued to increase in the fourth quarter, up at a solid 4.0 percent pace. With the exception of the third quarter, that was the strongest rate in seven quarters. Growth in the fourth quarter was widespread across almost all components of real GDP, a favorable condition for future growth.

Real personal consumption expenditures rose at a 2.6 percent rate, in line with the average gain in the five quarters prior to a 6.9 percent surge in the third quarter of 2003. That surge was affected by the start in July of lower tax withholding rates on individual income and the disbursement of advance rebates of an increased child tax credit; these provisions were contained in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA). These changes as well as provisions to stimulate business capital spending helped to spur the economy in the third quarter and raise the prospects for growth going forward. Business investment in equipment and software rose at a 17.6 percent pace in the third quarter and continued to grow at a strong 10 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Investment in inventories also contributed to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter as businesses became more optimistic about the sustainability of aggregate demand and began to rebuild depleted stocks.

Residential investment remained strong in the final quarter of the year, growing at a 10.6 percent pace after rising 21.9 percent in the third quarter. Favorable mortgage interest rates helped lead to near-record levels of new home sales and housing starts in 2003, boosting real residential investment in the second half of the year. The foreign trade sector was also a positive factor in the second half as exports grew much faster than imports, resulting in a smaller trade deficit. In the fourth quarter, exports rose at a strong 19.1

percent rate while imports grew at an 11.3 percent pace. The rise in exports was almost twice as fast as in the third quarter and the largest in 7 years.

In early December 2003, the Bureau of Economic Analysis introduced benchmark revisions to the data in the National Income and Product Accounts, in some cases extending back many years. In the Profile of the Economy section of the Treasury Bulletin, figures affected include GDP and all its components, disposable personal income and consumer spending, productivity, and net national saving and investment.

Growth of Real GDP

(Percent change, fourth quarter to fourth quarter)

Inflation

Inflation at the consumer level continued at a moderate pace in 2003, but there was some acceleration at the producer price level. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent during the year, down by one-half percentage point from the 2.4 percent pace recorded during 2002. Energy price increases slowed, to 6.9 percent from 10.7 percent in 2002. The cost of food was up by 3.6 percent last year, more the twice the 1.5 percent pace in the previous year. "Core" inflation (prices excluding food and energy) continued to slow during 2003, decelerating to a very low

1.1 percent pace from 1.9 percent during 2002. That represented the smallest annual increase since 1960.

At the producer level, finished goods prices rose by 4.0 percent last year. This followed a modest 1.2 percent increase during 2002. Rising energy costs and higher food prices contributed to the overall acceleration. Energy prices rose by 11.5 percent, close to the 12.3 percent increase registered in 2002. Wholesale food costs were up by 7.7 percent after dipping slightly in the prior year. Core prices increased by a modest 1.0 percent but this followed a slight decline during 2002. Further back in the production chain, the pace of core intermediate materials price increases

PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY

accelerated modestly from 1.5 percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent in 2003.

There continues to be little or no pressure on prices from rising labor costs. Hourly compensation costs (including stock options) as calculated in the national income accounts for the private nonfarm business sector increased by 3.3 percent during 2003. This was well below the 5.3 percent rise in productivity, yielding a 2.0 percent drop in unit labor

costs. Unit labor costs fell by 2.4 percent across the four quarters of 2002. The employment cost index (ECI) for total compensation, a fixed-weighted compensation measure that does not account for stock options, increased by 3.8 percent during 2003, boosted by a surge in benefit costs. This was up a little from a 3.4 percent increase in the previous year.

Producer Prices - Finished Goods

(Percent change from a year earlier)

Employment and unemployment

The improvement in the labor market that began late in the summer of 2003 continued into early 2004. The unemployment rate has retreated from a 9-year high of 6.3 percent in June 2003 to 5.6 percent in January 2004.

Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 112,000 in January on top of increases totaling 254,000 in the prior 4 months. The 5-month string of job gains was the best since the recession began in March 2001. Employment growth recorded since the August trough has been concentrated in the private service-producing sector, with particularly noteworthy advances in professional and business services, education, health services, and leisure and hospitality. Hiring in the construction industry has also strengthened recently. Manufacturing payrolls have continued to shrink and in January contracted for a 42nd straight month.

decline has slowed sharply, however, suggesting that an end to the downtrend in factory payrolls is near. About 3 million factory jobs have been lost since July 2000.

The unemployment rate edged down by 0.1 percentage point from December to 5.6 percent in January. The jobless rate declined by 0.7 percentage point from its cyclical peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003, and in January 2004 was at its lowest point in two years.

The apparent recovery in labor demand has not yet translated into stronger wage growth. Over the 12 months ended in January, average hourly earnings of nonfarm production workers rose just 2.0 percent–among the smallest year-over-year increases since 1987. Growth in earnings adjusted for inflation slowed to 0.2 percent over the 12 months ended in December (latest available) from 0.6 percent in the year-earlier period.

Real disposable personal income and consumer spending

Personal income in nominal terms grew by 3.7 percent across the four quarters of 2003. This followed increases of 2.4 percent in each of the previous 2 years. Wages and salaries, which account for more than half of personal income, grew at a 2.6 percent rate, or twice the 1.3 percent pace in 2002. Supplements to wages and salaries, which consist of employer contributions for pension and insurance funds and for government social insurance, grew by 5.7 percent during 2003 following an increase of 4.5 percent during 2002. Personal interest income declined but dividend income remained strong during 2003. Personal current transfer receipts, which include transfer payments from the government, grew by 6.5 percent last year, off a little from 6.8 percent in the previous year.

Disposable (after-tax) income adjusted for inflation rose by 3.2 percent during 2003 on top of a 3.5 percent gain during 2002. Inflation-adjusted disposable income was boosted last year by lower marginal tax rates and advance payments of the child tax credit legislated in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which was reflected in an annual rate increase of 6.3 percent in the third quarter.

Real consumer spending picked up last year, increasing at a 3.8 percent rate. This followed a 2.8 percent gain during 2002. The pace accelerated from 2.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2003 to a strong 6.9 percent in the

third quarter. The latter benefited from the boost in disposable income from the tax package. Growth in the fourth quarter slipped back to an annual rate of 2.6 percent. Consumer spending last year rose at a faster rate than after-tax income, pushing the personal saving rate down to a very low 1.5 percent by the fourth quarter. For the entire year, the saving rate stood at 2.0 percent, down from 2.3 percent during 2002.

Industrial production and capacity utilization

Industrial production showed continuing signs of strength in the latter part of 2003. Output from factories, mines, and utilities rose by a solid 6.2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace since mid-2000. Production increased for the fifth time in the past 6 months in December, edging up 0.1 percent. Output increased 2.3 percent in the latest 12 months.

Manufacturing production, which accounts for more than 83 percent of all industrial output, increased 0.3 percent in December, following a 1.0 percent jump in November. Factory output advanced by a strong 6.6 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter on top of the 3.7 percent gain posted in the third quarter. Production of motor vehicles and parts increased at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, representing a pullback from the strong 19.3 percent increase in the third quarter. Vehicle and part production rose 0.6 percent in December. Apart from automobiles,

PROFILE OF THE ECONOMY

manufacturing output rose 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter following a small 0.4 percent advance in the third quarter. Production in the high-technology industries (computers, communications equipment, and semiconductors) jumped by more than 33 percent at an annual rate in the third and fourth quarters, marking the strongest advance for this category in 3 years. Both the computers and office equipment sector and semiconductors accounted for the sharp gains in both quarters. Although communications equipment remains the least strongest segment of the high-technology group, it advanced by 12.3 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter after falling 6.7 percent in the third quarter. Nondurable manufacturing rose by 2.5 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, the strongest quarterly gain since mid-2000. Chemicals and apparel and leather accounted for much of the rise. Production at utilities, which accounts for almost 10 percent of total industrial output, rose by a 5.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter after a 6.8 percent rise in the third quarter. Output at mines (the remaining 7 percent of industrial output) rose a solid 3.0 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.

The capacity utilization rate for the industrial sector ended 2003 at 75.8 percent, up from June's two-decade low of 74.0 percent but still 5.5 percentage points below the long-term average of 81.3 percent. Capacity utilization ranged between 82 and 85 percent in the 1994-1999 period. Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector was 74.5 percent in December, 5.7 percentage points below its long-term average of 80.2 percent. Utilization in the high-tech industries has been on the rise lately and increased to 68.9 percent by the end of 2003, the highest reading since mid-2001. That is still well below its long-term average of 79.2 percent.

Nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs

Productivity continues to advance at a very impressive pace. Nonfarm business productivity (real output per hour worked) rose 2.7 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter following a blistering 9.5 percent gain in the third quarter. Over the most recent four quarters, labor productivity rose by 5.3 percent, well above the already rapid 3.1 percent annual pace averaged since 1995. This provides further evidence of an accelerated "New Economy" trend in recent years, compared to the 1973 through 1995 period, when productivity growth averaged only 1.4 percent per year.

Hourly labor compensation rose by 1.3 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and by 3.3 percent during the past four quarters. Unit labor costs remain contained due to the strong growth in productivity. Unit labor costs fell at a 1.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter and were down 2.0 percent over the latest four quarters. The year 2003 marked the second year in a row with falling unit labor costs, the

first back-to-back yearly declines in post-World War II history.

Productivity in manufacturing advanced by a 4.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and was up by a strong 5.2 percent over the most recent four quarters.

Hourly compensation in manufacturing advanced by 1.5 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and by 4.3 percent over the past four quarters. However, continued productivity gains have controlled unit labor costs. These costs fell at a 3.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter and were down 0.9 percent over the latest four quarters.

International transactions

The current account measures trade in goods and services as well as the flow of investment income and unilateral transfers (including government grants and pension payments, and private transfers to and from foreigners). The current account has been in deficit almost continuously since the early 1980s but has fluctuated widely over time. Steady growth of the trade deficit since late 2001 pushed the current account deficit to a record high of $556 billion at an annual rate (5.2 percent of GDP) in the first half of 2003. However, subsequent improvement in the trade balance combined with a sharp rise in the surplus on investment income and a decline in unilateral transfers caused the current account gap to recede in the third quarter to $540 billion (4.9 percent of GDP).

The current account is, by definition, matched by offsetting transactions in the capital and financial accounts, with any difference in the recorded flows listed as a statistical discrepancy. Capital account transactions, which mainly consist of debt forgiveness and wealth transfers associated with immigration, are typically small and in the second quarter fell to $3.2 billion at an annual rate from an outsized $6.2 billion in the prior quarter.

The financial account measures transactions that alter the foreign financial assets and liabilities of the United States. Net financial inflows slowed sharply in the third quarter to $493 billion at an annual rate from $600 billion in the second quarter. The pullback was due in part to a steep fall in net foreign purchases of assets in the United States to $513 billion at an annual rate, about half the prior quarter's $1,051 billion pace and the lowest volume of financial inflows since the third quarter of 2001. Foreign holdings of non-Treasury securities plunged, reflecting a sell-off of U.S. equities and federally-sponsored agency bonds and a decline in acquisitions of corporate bonds. Net foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries and foreign direct investment in the United States also slowed in the third quarter, but foreign official purchases remained strong. U.S. purchases of assets abroad also dropped in the third quarter to $20 billion at an annual rate from an average annual pace of $428 billion in the first half of 2003. A large decline in U.S. banks' claims on foreigners accounted for much of the decline.

Exchange rate of the dollar

The dollar's trend lower from a peak in February 2002 continued throughout the fall and early winter. In the 23 months between that peak and January, the nominal exchange value of the dollar relative to a broad index covering the currencies of 26 important U.S. trade partners has depreciated by 13.1 percent. This decline follows a period of sustained appreciation that saw the dollar's value surge by 12 percent between December 1999 and February 2002.

The decline has been a function mainly of dollar weakness against the seven currencies of the United States major trading partners, including the euro area countries, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, and Switzerland. Since February 2002, the exchange rate of the dollar compared to an index of these currencies has fallen by 24.6 percent. Dollar depreciation against the yen and the euro, whose combined weights account for roughly 55

percent of the major index, has been largely responsible. Over the same period, the dollar/euro exchange rate fell by 31.1 percent and the dollar/ yen exchange rate fell by 20.5 percent, reflecting U.S. current account deficit concerns, brighter prospects for growth in Europe, indications that U.S. monetary policy would remain very accommodative, and despite strong growth in the U.S. economy and strong performances in U.S. equity markets.

The dollar remains relatively strong compared with the currencies of many other important trading partners, although the pace of its appreciation in the most recent months has slowed somewhat. Since February 2002, the exchange value of the dollar compared to an index of currencies that includes Mexico, China, Brazil, and seven other Asian countries has appreciated by 3.4 percent. Since December 1999, this index has risen by 10.4 percent.

Interest rates

The Federal Reserve's monetary stance remains extremely accommodative. Since 2000, the Federal Open Market Committee has reduced the federal funds rate (the rate that banks and other financial institutions charge each other for overnight loans) 13 times, for a total of 5.5 percentage points, to 1 percent, its lowest level since 1958.

In the Treasury market, interest rates of all tenors eased substantially between 2000 and spring 2003. From a level above 6 percent in late 2000, the 3-month Treasury bill rate has declined almost steadily, and has remained below 1 percent since June 2003 (and in some weeks, has edged below 0.9 percent). The 10-year Treasury yield trended downward from above 6.5 percent in early 2000 to less than 3.25 percent in June 2003. Thereafter, rates moved broadly higher, reaching slightly above 4.5 percent in early September. Since then, the 10-year yield has edged lower, fluctuating in a range of 4.0 percent and 4.3 percent as of January and early February.

Mortgage interest rates generally follow movements of the 10-year Treasury rate. The interest rate on a conventional 30-year fixed-rate loan fell from a monthly average peak of

8.5 percent in May 2000 to under 5.25 percent at mid-June and an annual average of 5.82 percent for 2003–lows not seen since the mid-1960s. Such exceptionally low rates boosted mortgage refinancings to record levels and helped free additional cash for consumption. The rate rose to an average of 6.25 percent in August, but has since edged lower in tandem with the general decline in 10-year Treasury yields, to an average of 5.74 percent as of January.

Corporate bond yields reflect movements in long-term Treasury yields as well as numerous other factors. Moody's seasoned Baa yield on corporate bonds reached a monthly average peak of almost 9 percent in May 2000. Since then, it has declined on trend, but has been buffeted by financial reporting scandals as well as perceptions of rising corporate and economic risks. More recently, the yield has declined on evidence of faster growth and rising corporate profits, reaching an average 6.47 percent in January. The spread between the Baa yield and the 10-year Treasury yield, a measure of investor risk appetite, increased to nearly 4 percentage points in late 2002, but has since narrowed sharply, to an average of 2.3 percentage points as of January.

Housing

The housing sector turned in an exceptional performance in 2003, with several housing indicators rising to their highest levels in a generation. Sales of new single-family homes eased by 4 percent in the fourth quarter to an annualized rate of 1.109 million from a quarterly all-time high of 1.155 million in the third quarter. Even so, sales for the entire year set a new record of 1.087 million, surging nearly 12 percent past the previous high of 972,000 recorded in 2002. Resales of existing single-family homes also moderated in the final 3 months of 2003 from their third-quarter peak, but for the entire year rose 9-1/2 percent to a new high of 6.099 million.

The remarkable performance of the housing market is due in large part to the low interest rate environment. The mortgage rate for a 30-year conventional fixed-rate loan crept up from a historically low 5.21 percent in late June to an average of 6.26 percent in the month of August, but eased back to an average of 5.88 percent in December. Demand for new homes was little affected by the modest increase in the mortgage rate as housing fundamentals remained favorable, including expansion of the home-buying population, the relative safety of housing as an investment, and continued home price appreciation. Refinancing activity slowed as rates rose, but many homeowners will continue to benefit from past refinancings through reduced monthly mortgage payments and a lower debt burden, factors that will continue to support consumer spending and the economy.

Strong demand for new homes triggered a jump in construction in 2003. Housing starts shot up by 37 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter to 2.040 million (also

That helped lift starts for the entire year by 8-1/2 percent to 1.8 million, making 2003 the best year for homebuilding since 1978. Starts of single-family homes in 2003 totaled 1.499 million, the highest on record. Starts in the smaller and more volatile multi-family sector rose to 350,000, the highest since 1986.

Federal budget

The Administration's Fiscal Year 2005 Budget projects that the Federal deficit will reach almost $521 billion in fiscal year 2004. That would be about $146 billion higher than the $375 billion deficit in fiscal year 2003 and a new record in level terms. However, in relation to the more than $11 trillion U.S. economy, the fiscal year 2004 deficit would be 4.5 percent of GDP, below or the same as shares reached in 6 of the past 21 years, including a peak of 6.0 percent in fiscal year 1983. The deficit is projected to shrink by $157 billion in fiscal year 2005 to $364 billion and continue to diminish each year through the rest of the forecast horizon, which extends to fiscal year 2009. The improvement stems from a growing economy and tight controls on outlays, particularly discretionary spending unrelated to defense or homeland security.

Receipts are projected to edge up 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2004 following a 3-year drop and thereafter grow by an average of about 8 percent a year through fiscal year 2009. Growth in outlays is projected to be 7.5 percent in fiscal year 2004, but then slow to less than half that pace in the next two fiscal years before rising about 5 percent on average in fiscal years 2007 to 2009. The budget calls for increases of 7 percent in defense spending in fiscal year 2005 and 10

percent for homeland security while growth in the rest of discretionary spending is held to 0.5 percent.

The economic projections underpinning the budget estimates show that real GDP grows 4.4 percent in calendar year 2004 on an annual basis compared to the 3.1 percent annual increase recorded in 2003. Growth is expected to taper over the succeeding years to 3.1 percent by 2009, the estimated potential rate of growth of the economy. The economic forecast is in line with the consensus of private sector analysts.

Debt held by the public was $3.9 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2003 and is projected to rise to $4.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004 and to $5.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2009. As a percent of GDP, debt over the forecast horizon rises from 36.1 percent in fiscal year 2003 to 40.2 percent in fiscal year 2007, then recedes to 39.8 percent in fiscal year 2009 as deficits diminish and the economy continues to post solid growth. The 40.2 percent share is well below the more than 45 percent share that prevailed from the late 1980s through most of the 1990s and recent peaks of more than 49 percent in the mid-1990s.

Net national saving and investment

Net national saving, the source of funds for new investment, fell to 1.3 percent of net national product (NNP) in the first three quarters of 2003 (latest available data) from 2.7 percent in 2002 and a recent high of 7.3 percent in 1998. (Net national saving and NNP exclude depreciation to replace worn-out or obsolete equipment, software and structures used in production.)

The decline in the net national saving rate in 2003 mostly stemmed from a widening in the Federal budget deficit from 2.6 percent of NNP in calendar year 2002 to 4.3 percent in the first three quarters of last year. The deficit largely reflected the effects of the recession and the need for spending on homeland security following the terrorist attacks in 2001. State and local government budgets also fell into a deficit of 0.1 percent of NNP in the first three quarters of 2003. Combined, the total public sector deficit was 4.5 percent of NNP in the first three quarters of last year and 2.6 percent of NNP in calendar year 2002. Even so, the current deficit is only a little above public sector deficits averaging 3.8 percent of NNP from 1982 to 1995.

In the first three quarters of last year, private saving was 5.8 percent of NNP, up from the 5.4 percent reached in 2002 but well above the rate of 3.6 percent in 2001, which was the lowest rate since 1938. Personal saving eased to 1.8 percent of NNP in the first three quarters of last year from 2.0 percent in 2002, but remained above the 1.4 percent recorded in 2001, which was the lowest in 50 years. Retained earnings of corporations rose to 3.9 percent of NNP in the first three quarters of last year from 3.4 percent in 2002 and 2.2 percent in 2001, reflecting the recovery in corporate profits.

Net domestic investment (by government and private industry in structures, equipment, software, and inventory) was at 7.0 percent of NNP in the first three quarters of last year, the same as in 2002. Net investment averaged over 9-1/2 percent from 1998 through 2000; nevertheless, the most recent rates of investment are higher than rates at 6 percent or below in 1991 and 1992. A large part of investment during the last decade was financed from abroad. The U.S. balance on current account swung from 0.3 percent of NNP in 1991 to -5.5 percent in the first three quarters of last year.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usually takes the form of appropriations that allow obligations to be incurred and payments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have expired or would otherwise expire. These are counted as new budget authority in the fiscal year of the legislation in which the reappropriation act is included, regardless of when the amounts were originally appropriated or when they would otherwise lapse.

Obligations generally are liquidated by the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash—outlays. Obligations may also be liquidated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned-income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts. Total Government receipts are compared with total outlays in calculating the budget surplus or deficit.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipt accounts). The former normally can be used without an appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements to appropriations. For accounting purposes, earned reimbursements are also known as revenues. These offsetting collections are netted against gross outlays in determining net outlays from such appropriations; and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust); offsetting collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into three categories: (1) proprietary receipts, or collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function; (2) intragovernmental transactions, or payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts. They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts; and (3) offsetting governmental receipts that include foreign cash contributions.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions—payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and outlays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept set forth in the "Report of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts" as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1969. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government's fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them outside of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Postal Service.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit ordinarily are not subject to targets set by the Congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (2 United States Code 900-922)] included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused on both on- and off-budget receipts, outlays and deficit of the Government.

Tables FFO-1, FFO-2, and FFO-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, estimates for 2 years detail for 13 months, and fiscal year-to-date data. They provide a summary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal entities and disbursing officers, and daily reports from the FRBs. They also detail accounting transactions affecting receipts and outlays of the Government and off-budget Federal entities and their related effect on assets and liabilities of the Government. Data are derived from the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government."

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets, and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FF0-2 includes on- and off-budget receipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FFO-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FFO-4 summarizes on- and off-budget receipts by source and outlays by function as reported to each major fund group classification for the current fiscal year to date and prior fiscal year to date.

Table FFO-5 summarizes internal revenue receipts by states and by type of tax. Amounts reported are collections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), payments made with tax returns and subsequent payments made after tax returns are due or are filed (that is, payments with delinquent returns or on delinquent accounts).

Amounts are reported based on the primary filing address provided by each taxpayer or reporting entity. For multistate corporations, the address may reflect only the district where such a corporation reported its taxes from a principal office rather than other districts where income was earned or where individual income and Social Security taxes were withheld. In addition, an individual may reside in one district and work in another.

Table FFO-6 includes customs collection of duties, taxes, and fees by districts and ports.

First-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 supplements fiscal data reported in the December issue of the "Treasury Bulletin." At the time of that issue's release, not enough data were available to analyze adequately collections for the quarter.

Individual income taxes—Individual income tax receipts, net of refunds, were $198.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. This is an increase of $1.0 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Withheld receipts decreased by $1.2 billion and non-withheld receipts increased by $1.9 billion during this period. Refunds decreased by $0.4 billion over the comparable fiscal year 2003 quarter. There was an increase of $4.5 billion in accounting adjustments between individual income tax receipts and the Social Security and Medicare trust funds over the comparable quarter in fiscal year 2003.

Corporate income taxes—Net corporate income tax receipts were $43.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. This is an increase of $10.2 billion compared to the prior year first quarter. The $10.2 billion change is comprised of an increase of $6.9 billion in estimated and

final payments, and a decrease of $3.3 billion in corporate refunds.

Employment taxes and contributions—Employment taxes and contributions receipts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $155.9 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance trust funds did not change significantly, while receipts to the Federal Hospital Insurance trust fund decreased by $0.6 billion. There was a -$4.5 billion accounting adjustment for prior years employment tax liabilities made in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004.

Unemployment insurance—Unemployment insurance receipts, net of refunds, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $4.8 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion over the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2003. Net State taxes deposited in the U.S. Treasury increased by $0.6 billion to $4.0 billion. Net Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes did not change significantly from $0.8 billion.

Contributions for other insurance and retirement—Contributions for other retirement were $1.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. This was a negligible change from the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2003.

Excise taxes—Net excise tax receipts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $16.4 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Total excise tax refunds for the quarter were $0.2 billion, not a significant change over the comparable prior year quarter.

Estate and gift taxes—Net estate and gift tax receipts were $5.8 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. These receipts represent an increase of $0.2 billion over the same quarter in fiscal year 2003.

Customs duties—Customs duties net of refunds were $5.1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. This is an increase of $0.2 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Miscellaneous receipts—Net miscellaneous receipts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $9.8 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. This change is due in part to deposits of earnings by Federal Reserve banks increasing by $0.7 billion.

INTRODUCTION: Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The Department of the Treasury's (Treasury's) operating cash is maintained in accounts with the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs) and branches, as well as in tax and loan accounts in other financial institutions. Major information sources include FRBs, Treasury Regional Financial Centers, Internal Revenue Service Centers, Bureau of the Public Debt, and various electronic systems. As the FRB accounts are depleted, funds are called in (withdrawn) from thousands of tax and loan accounts at financial institutions throughout the country.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147 (codified at 31 United States Code 323), Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositaries maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan (TT&L) investment program, depositary financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate. Financial institutions wishing to retain funds deposited into their tax

and loan accounts in interest-bearing obligations can participate. The program permits Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in TT&L depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way, Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuating operations on TT&L financial institution reserves and on the economy. Likewise, those institutions wishing to remit the funds to the Treasury account at FRBs do so as collector depositaries.

Deposits to tax and loan accounts occur as customers of financial institutions deposit tax payments that the financial institutions use to purchase Government securities. In most cases, this involves a transfer of funds from a customer's account to the tax and loan account in the same financial institution. Also, Treasury can direct the FRBs to invest excess funds in tax and loan accounts directly from the Treasury account at the FRBs.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities issued by other Federal agencies accounting for the rest. Tables in this section of the “Treasury Bulletin” reflect the total. Further detailed information is published in the “Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States.” Likewise, information on agency securities and on investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”

Effective January 1, 2001, Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt revised formats, titles, and column headings in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States," Table I: Summary of Treasury Securities Outstanding and Table II: Statutory Debt Limit. These changes should reduce confusion and bring the publication more in line with the public's use of terms.

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" tables FD-2 and FD-6 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Effective June 2001, FMS revised procedures and categories in these tables to agree with the Bureau of the Public Debt's publication changes.

Table FD-1 summarizes the Federal debt by listing public debt and agency securities held by the public, including the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agencies, largely by the Social Security and other Federal retirement trust funds. The net unamortized premium and discount also are listed by total Federal securities, securities held by Government accounts and securities held by the public. The difference between the outstanding face value of the Federal debt and the net unamortized premium and discount is classified as the accrual amount. (For greater detail on holdings of Federal securities by particular classes of investors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type, that is, marketable and nonmarketable, the total public debt securities outstanding that are held by the public.

Table FD-2 (Historical) categorizes by type interest-bearing marketable and nonmarketable Treasury securities. The difference between interest-bearing and total public debt securities reflects outstanding matured Treasury securities—that is, unredeemed securities that have matured and are no longer accruing interest. Because the Federal Financing Bank is under the supervision of Treasury, its securities are held by a U.S. Government account.

In table FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by issues to particular funds within Government.

funds invest in par value special series nonmarketables at interest rates determined by law. Others invest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents interest-bearing securities issued by Government agencies. Federal agency borrowing has declined in recent years, in part because the Federal Financing Bank has provided financing to other Federal agencies. (Federal agency borrowing from Treasury is presented in the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”)

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt.

In March 1971, Congress enacted a limited exception to the amount of bonds with rates greater than 4-1/4 percent that could be held by the public. This permitted Treasury to offer securities maturing in more than 7 years at current market interest rates for the first time since 1965. In March 1976, the definition of a bond was changed to include those securities longer than 10 years to maturity. This exception has expanded since 1971, authorizing Treasury to continue to issue long-term securities. The ceiling on Treasury bonds was repealed on November 10, 1988.

The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the FRBs.

In table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling.

In table FD-6 (Historical), the same debt information is compared as in table FD-6. Changes in the non-interest-bearing debt shown in the last column reflect maturities of Treasury securities on nonbusiness days, which can be redeemed on the next business day.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Public Debt Operations

Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment, and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each outstanding marketable security is listed in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." The information in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" pertains only to marketable Treasury securities.

Table PDO-1 provides a maturity schedule of interest-bearing marketable Treasury notes and bonds. All unmatured Treasury notes and bonds are listed in maturity order, from earliest to latest. A separate breakout is provided for the combined holdings of the Government accounts and Federal Reserve banks (FRBs), so that the "all other investors" category includes all private holdings.

Table PDO-2 presents the results of weekly auctions of 4-, 13-, and 26-week bills. Treasury bills mature each

Thursday. Issues of 4- and 13-week bills are reopenings of 26-week bills. Issues of cash management bills also are presented. High yields on accepted tenders and the dollar value of total bids are presented, with the dollar value of awards made on both competitive and noncompetitive bases.

To encourage the participation of individuals and smaller institutions, Treasury accepts noncompetitive tenders of up to $1 million for bills and $5 million for notes and bonds in each auction of securities.

Table PDO-3 lists the results of auctions of marketable securities, other than weekly bills, in chronological order over the past 2 years.

Table PDO-4 indicates the total amount of marketable securities allotted to each class of investor. The FRBs tally into investor classes the tenders in each auction of marketable securities other than weekly auctions of 4-, 13-, and 26-week bills.

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, notes, and bonds that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. [See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.]

Effective January 1, 2001, Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt revised formats, titles, and column headings in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States," Table I: Summary of Treasury Securities Outstanding and Table II: Statutory Debt Limit. These changes should reduce confusion and bring the publication more in line with the public's use of terms.

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" table OFS-1 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Effective June 2001, FMS revised procedures and categories in this table to agree with the Bureau of the Public Debt's publication changes.

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and nonmarketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the FRBs, and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The FRBs acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated amount of public debt securities held by private investors. Information is obtained from sources such as the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies. State, local, and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and foreign official accounts. They also include municipal, foreign official, and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes to the table for description of investor categories.)

INTRODUCTION: Market Yields

The table and chart in this section presents yields on Treasury marketable securities for maturities ranging from 1-month to 20-years.

Table MY-1 lists Treasury market bid yields at constant maturities for bills, notes, and bonds. The Treasury yield curve in the accompanying chart is based on current market bid quotations on the most actively traded Treasury securities as of 3:30 p.m. on the last business day of the calendar quarter.

The Treasury uses quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to derive the yield curve, based on semiannual interest payments and read at constant maturity points to develop a consistent data series. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes the Treasury constant maturity data series in its weekly Statistical Release H.15.

On July 31, 2001, Treasury expanded its constant maturity index to include a 1-month constant maturity yield, and Table MY-1 now includes a 1-month maturity beginning on that date. On February 18, 2002, Treasury discontinued the 30-year constant maturity yield. In lieu of the 30-year yield, Table MY-1 will include a 20-year maturity. Historical data for the 20-year maturity is available from the Board of Governors' Statistical Release H.15.

Prior to January 2003, this section also included data on long-term Treasury, corporate and municipal yields (Table MY-2). Effective January 2003, Table MY-2 and Chart MY-B have been discontinued because Treasury no longer issues long-term bonds and no longer calculates or estimates long-term corporate rates.

INTRODUCTION: U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation

The U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation (USCC) statement informs the public of the total face value of currency and coin used as a medium of exchange that is in circulation at the end of a given accounting month. The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion deemed to be in circulation. It includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate or that may do so to a limited extent. Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various issues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census. USCC information has been published by Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when it was incorporated into the "Treasury Bulletin." The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs), and the Federal Reserve Board.

1 Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) adopted a technique for valuing the special drawing right (SDR) based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and reserve position in the IMF also are valued on this basis beginning July 1974.
2 Treasury values its gold stock at $42,222 per fine troy ounce and pursuant to 31 United States Code 5117 (b) issues gold certificates to the Federal Reserve at the same rate against all gold held.
3 Includes allocations of SDRs in the Special Drawing Account in the IMF, plus or minus transactions in SDRs.

4 Includes holdings of Treasury and Federal Reserve System; beginning November 1978, these are valued at current market exchange rates or, where appropriate, at such other rates as may be agreed upon by the parties to the transactions.
5 The United States has the right to purchase foreign currencies equivalent to its reserve position in the IMF automatically if needed. Under appropriate conditions, the United States could purchase additional amounts related to the U.S. quota.
6 Includes an SDR $361 million loan to the IMF under the General Arrangements to Borrow in July 1998, and an SDR $619 million loan to the IMF under the New Arrangements to Borrow in December 1998.

INTRODUCTION: Capital Movements

Background

Data relating to U.S. international transactions in financial instruments and to other portfolio capital movements between the United States and foreign countries have been collected in some form since 1935. This information is necessary for compiling the U.S. balance of payments accounts, for calculating the U.S. international investment position, and for use in formulating U.S. international financial and monetary policies.

From the beginning, reporting under the Treasury data collection program has been mandatory. Under the current Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system, an assortment of monthly, quarterly, and semiannual reports are filed with district Federal Reserve banks by commercial banks, securities dealers, other financial institutions, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States. These data are centrally processed and maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which, along with the district banks, acts as fiscal agent for Treasury. Beginning in late 1998, the Federal Reserve Board also undertakes services on behalf of Treasury in support of the TIC data collection system. The TIC reports of individual respondents are treated as confidential, and access to the respondent level data and to some sensitive data aggregates is strictly limited to specific staff of Treasury and the Federal Reserve System.

Data derived from Treasury reports are published in the Capital Movements section of this quarterly Treasury Bulletin and are posted monthly on the TIC website, http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. (See NOTE at the end of the INTRODUCTION text for additional website information.) TIC data aggregates are also published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and are used in the U.S. international transactions and investment position compilations published by the Department of Commerce in the Survey of Current Business.

Forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultation with representatives of banks, securities firms, and nonbanking enterprises. The most recent revisions to selected reporting forms and instructions were effective February 28, 2003. The major changes are outlined under "Description of statistics" below. Copies of the reporting forms and instructions may be obtained from the Office of Program Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220; the International Finance Division, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551; or district FRBs. Reporting forms and instructions also may be downloaded from the TIC website.

Basic definitions

The term "foreigner" as used in TIC reporting covers all institutions and individuals resident outside the United

States, including U.S. citizens domiciled abroad; the foreign branches, subsidiaries and offices of U.S. banks and business concerns; the central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of foreign countries, wherever located; and international and regional organizations, wherever located. The term "foreigner" also includes persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting on behalf of foreigners.

In general, information is reported opposite the country or geographical area where the foreigner is located, as shown on records of reporting institutions. This information may not always reflect the ultimate ownership of assets. Reporting institutions are not required to go beyond addresses shown on their records and may not be aware of the actual country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary.

Transactions with branches or agencies of foreign official institutions, wherever located, are reported opposite the country that has sovereignty over the institutions. Transactions with international and regional organizations are not reported opposite any single country, but are accounted for in regional groupings of such organizations. The only exception is information pertaining to the Bank for International Settlements, which is reported opposite "Other Europe." For purposes of publication only, information on the European Central Bank also is included in "Other Europe."

"Short-term" refers to obligations payable on demand or having an original maturity of one year or less. "Long-term" refers to obligations having an original maturity of more than one year and includes securities having no maturity.

Reporting coverage

TIC reports are required from banks and other depository institutions, bank/financial holding companies (BHCs/FHCs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking concerns in the United States, including the branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and other affiliates in the United States of foreign banking and nonbanking firms. Institutions with total reportable liabilities, claims, or securities transactions below specified reporting thresholds are exempt from reporting.

Beginning in February 2003, substantial revisions to the coverage and formats of the TIC B-series and C-series forms were introduced. The reasons for the changes were to comply with new and expanded international standards for reporting data on portfolio investment; to reduce reporting burden; to clarify reporting concepts and instructions; and to improve the quality of the series by closing known gaps in the data. Notices of these changes and requests for public comments on them were published in the Federal Register last year and some modifications were made in response to the comments received. A detailed outline of the changes affecting each form may be accessed on the TIC website.

CAPITAL MOVEMENTS

61

Banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers file monthly B-series reports covering their dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on foreigners in a number of countries. Twice a year, June 30 and December 31, they also report the same liabilities and claims items attributed to foreigners in countries not shown separately on the monthly reports. Quarterly reports are filed for liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies and for claims on foreigners held for respondents' domestic customers. All positions are exclusive of long-term securities. Beginning January 2001, the exemption level applicable to the banking reports was raised from $15 million to $50 million. This exemption level is also subject to the provision that reportable amounts for any one country do not exceed $25 million.

Banks and other depository institutions, securities brokers and dealers, and other entities report their transactions with foreigners by country in long-term securities on monthly Form S. Respondents must report securities transactions with foreigners if their aggregate purchases or their aggregate sales amount to at least $50 million during the covered month.

Quarterly reports are filed by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions, and securities firms), and other nonbanking enterprises on their liabilities and claims positions with foreigners. Except as noted below under "Description of statistics," the reportable liabilities and claims positions are with unaffiliated foreigners. Separate reports are filed for financial balances and for commercial balances. Effective for reports filed as of March 31, 2003, the threshold applicable to Form CQ-1 for reporting financial liabilities to, and claims on, foreigners is $50 million, up from $10 million. At the same time, the reporting threshold for Form CQ-2, which covers commercial liabilities and claims positions with foreigners, was raised from $10 million to $25 million.

The data in these tables do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and other countries. Except as noted in Section IV in "Description of statistics" below, the principal exclusions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies (own foreign offices) and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce in its regular reports on the U.S. balance of payments.

Description of statistics

Data collected on the TIC forms are published in the "Capital Movements" tables in five sections. Each section contains all the data relevant to the same statistical series, with tables showing time series by type and country, and detailed breakdowns of the latest available data.

Section I covers liabilities to foreigners reported by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. BHCs/FHCs also report for all domestic nonbank, non-securities firm affiliates, other than their insurance affiliates, which report separately on the C-series forms. Dollar-denominated liabilities are reported monthly on Forms BL-1 and BL-2. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported quarterly on Form BQ-2. Respondents report certain of their own liabilities and a wide range of their custody liabilities to foreigners. Effective with reports filed as of February 28, 2003, coverage was broadened to cover the positions of U.S. broker-dealer respondents with their affiliated foreign offices. (Depository institutions and BHCs/FHCs already reported such positions.) The scope of the reports was also extended to include cross-border brokerage balances as well as offshore sweep accounts and loans to U.S. residents in “managed” foreign offices of U.S. reporting institutions. Additionally, in a new Part 2, Form BQ-2 was expanded to include the foreign currency-denominated liabilities held by respondents for their domestic customers. Further, banks’ own positions have been defined to be consistent with regulatory reports such as the FR 2950/2951 to include all amounts in the respondent’s “due to/due from” accounts, unless in an instrument that is specifically excluded. Finally, the columns for demand deposits and non-transactions accounts are now combined, as are short-term U.S. agency securities and other negotiable and readily transferable instruments.

Section II presents claims on foreigners reported by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. BHCs/FHCs also report for their domestic nonbank and non-securities firm affiliates, other than their insurance affiliates, which report separately on the C-series forms. Data on respondents' own dollar claims are collected monthly on Form BC. Information on claims held for domestic customers as well as on claims denominated in foreign currencies is collected on a quarterly basis only on Forms BQ-1 and BQ-2, respectively. Effective with reports filed as of February 28, 2003, reporting coverage was expanded as outlined in Section I. Additionally, columns were added for separate reporting of negotiable CDs and other short-term negotiable instruments issued by foreigners. Further, the foreigner category, "foreign official institutions," replaced the former, broader category, "foreign public borrowers," for consistency with the liabilities reporting on this sector.

Section III contains supplementary data on dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, countries not listed separately on the monthly reports submitted by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. The supplementary reports are filed semiannually as of the end of June and December.

Section IV shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners of exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than

banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers), and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Data exclude claims on foreigners held by banks in the United States.

Historically, the information does not include any accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. These are reported by business enterprises to Commerce on its direct investment forms. However, effective with reports filed as of March 31, 2003, a number of changes were introduced in the coverage and reporting formats of nonbanking forms. A major revision is the addition of Section B to Form CQ-1 to capture foreign affiliate positions (including those with affiliates of the respondent's parent) of insurance underwriting subsidiaries and financial intermediaries. Insurance underwriting subsidiaries of BHCs/FHCs now include positions vis-à-vis all foreign-resident affiliates. From end-March 2003 forward, financial intermediaries are to report positions vis-à-vis all foreign-resident affiliated financial intermediaries.

Section V contains information on transactions with foreigners in long-term domestic and foreign securities as reported by banks, securities brokers and dealers, and other entities in the United States. The data cover transactions executed in the United States for the accounts of foreigners and transactions executed abroad for the accounts of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. This includes transactions in newly-issued securities as well as transactions in, and redemptions of, outstanding issues.

However, the data do not include nonmarketable Treasury bonds and notes shown in table IFS-3.

The geographical allocation of the transactions data indicates the country of location of the foreign buyers and sellers who deal directly with reporting institutions in the United States. The data do not necessarily indicate the country of beneficial owner or issuer, or the currency of denomination of securities. For instance, a U.S. purchaser's order for Japanese securities may be placed directly with an intermediary in London. In this instance, the transaction for Form S reporting purposes would be recorded opposite the United Kingdom and not opposite Japan. Similarly, purchases and sales of U.S. securities for the account of an Italian resident may be placed, for example, in the Swiss market. In that case, the trades would be reported opposite Switzerland and not opposite Italy.

NOTE: Current and historical data on United States transactions with foreigners in long-term securities and on the gross foreign liabilities and claims reported by banks in the United States are available on the TIC website: http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. These data may be downloaded as separate time series for each country or geographical area regularly shown in the capital movements tables. Also available on this website are other series, including a table on “Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities,” showing estimated total holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes for current and recent periods. All data series on the TIC website are updated monthly.

CHART CM-A.—U.S. Liabilities to Foreigners

Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers, and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

U.S. banking liabilities to foreigners, excluding long-term securities, were recorded at about $2.4 trillion in December 2003, an increase of about $332 billion from yearend 2002. Much of the increase in liabilities to foreigners in 2003 reflects changes to the reporting scope of the TIC reporting system effective February 2003. Between March and December, when data are reported on a consistent basis, banking liabilities increased about $117 billion. U.S. banking liabilities increased about $356 billion in 2002, and $121 billion in 2001.

U.S. banking liabilities are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that more than half of U.S. banking liabilities currently is recorded against the United Kingdom and banking centers in the Caribbean. These financial centers have recorded most of the growth in banking liabilities in recent years, and also recorded most of the reported increase in liabilities in 2003. Foreigners domiciled in the rest of Europe and in Asia account for about 35 percent of U.S. banking liabilities.

In September 2003, U.S. banking claims, excluding long-term securities, amounted to nearly $1.8 trillion, an increase of about $230 billion from yearend 2002. In large part, the increase in claims reflects changes to the reporting scope of the TIC reporting system effective February 2003. Between March and September, when data are reported on a consistent basis, banking claims increased $51 billion. U.S. banking claims increased $165 billion in 2002, and $174 billion in 2001.

As with U.S. banking liabilities, U.S. banking claims on foreigners are concentrated in international financial centers. About 60 percent of these claims are reported opposite the United Kingdom and banking centers in the Caribbean. These financial centers accounted for most of the increase in U.S. banking claims through September of 2003. The share of claims against foreigners domiciled in Asia has declined over the past several years from about 20 percent at the end of 1996 to less than 10 percent currently.

The data on this page represent foreign investors' purchases and sales of long-term U.S. securities (that is, U.S. Treasury and Government agency bonds and notes, and U.S. corporate bonds and stocks) as reported to the TIC reporting system. Foreign investors also acquired U.S. equities through mergers that involve stock swaps. Net foreign acquisitions of U.S. equities through stock swaps amounted to $21 billion in 2000, $7 billion in both 2001 and 2002, and zero in 2003. (Stock swaps data for the most recent quarter are Federal Reserve Board/Treasury estimates and are subject to substantial revisions.) These stock swaps are not reported under the TIC reporting system, but are now available on the TIC web site.

The data present aggregate net purchases for 2000 through 2003. The figures show that foreigners' annual net purchases (gross purchases minus gross sales) of U.S. securities have maintained an extremely high level since 2000.

Annual net foreign purchases of U.S. securities first surpassed $100 billion in 1993. In 2002, net acquisitions (including stock swaps) of U.S. securities totaled a record $554 billion. In 2003, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities accelerated to a record $744 billion.

CHART CM-D.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Foreign Securities by U.S. Investors*

The data on this page represent U.S. investors' purchases and sales of long-term foreign securities as reported to the TIC reporting system. However, in the past several years, U.S. investors also have acquired a substantial amount of foreign stocks, mostly European, through mergers that involve stock swaps. Net acquisitions through stock swaps amounted to $80 billion in 2000, $45 billion in 2001, only $3 billion in 2002, and $15 billion in 2003. (Stock swaps data for the most recent quarter are Federal Reserve Board/Treasury estimates and are subject to substantial revisions.) These stock swaps are not reported under the TIC reporting system, but are now available on the TIC web site.

Including the stock swaps, annual U.S. net purchases of long-term foreign securities averaged about $100 billion from the mid-1990s through 2000, without much variation from year to year. U.S. investors’ acquisitions of foreign securities (including stock swaps) fell to $65 billion in 2001. In 2002, on net U.S. investors sold $24 billion in foreign securities. In 2003, strong U.S. demand for foreign equities offset net sales of foreign bonds; on net (including stock swaps), U.S. investors acquired $52 billion in foreign securities in the year.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

The "Treasury Bulletin" reports foreign currency holdings of large foreign exchange market participants. These reports provide information on positions in derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange futures and options, that are increasingly used in establishing foreign exchange positions but were not covered in the old reports.

The information is based on reports of large foreign exchange market participants on holdings of five major foreign currencies (Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound sterling, and euro) and the U.S. dollar. Positions in the U.S. dollar, which have been collected since January 1999, are intended to approximate "all other" currency positions of reporting institutions. U.S.-based businesses file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, branches, and agencies. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Filing is required by law (31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Regulations 128, Subpart C).

Weekly and monthly reports must be filed throughout the calendar year by major foreign exchange market participants, which are defined as market participants with more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (end March, June, September, or December). Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold.

A quarterly report must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange market participant that had more than $5 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any quarter the previous year (end March, June, September, or December).

This information is published in six sections corresponding to each of the major currencies covered by the reports. Tables I-1 through VI-1 present the currency data reported weekly by major market participants. Tables I-2 through VI-2 present more detailed currency data of major market participants, based on monthly Treasury and Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 035 reports. Tables I-3 through VI-3 present quarterly consolidated currency data reported by large market participants and FFIEC reporters that do not file weekly reports.

Principal exchanged under cross-currency interest rate swaps is reported as part of purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Such principal also was noted separately on monthly and quarterly reports through December 1998, when this practice was discontinued. The net options position, or the net delta-equivalent value of an options position, is an estimate of the relationship between an option's value and an equivalent currency hedge. The delta equivalent value is defined as the product of the first partial derivative of an option valuation formula (with respect to the price of the underlying currency) multiplied by the notional principal of the contract.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established pursuant to chapter 6, section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (codified at 31 United States Code 5302), which authorized establishment of a Treasury fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose somewhat to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Resources of the fund include dollar balances, partially invested in U.S. Government securities, special drawing rights (SDRs), and balances of foreign currencies. Principal sources of income (+) or loss (-) for the fund are profits (+) or losses (-) on SDRs and foreign exchange, as well as interest earned on assets.

Table ESF-1 presents the assets, liabilities, and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents based on current exchange rates computed according to the accrual method of accounting. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the International Monetary Fund. Gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income (+) or loss (-) account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations by quarter. Figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents computed according to the accrual method. “Profit (+) or loss (-) on foreign exchange” includes realized profits or losses. “Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations” reflects net gain or loss on revaluation of SDR holdings and allocations for the quarter.

1 Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund adopted a technique for valuing the SDRs based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and allocations are valued on this basis beginning July 1974.

Note.— Annual balance sheets for fiscal years 1934 through 1940 appeared in the 1940 "Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury" and those for succeeding years appeared in subsequent reports through 1980. Quarterly balance sheets beginning with December 31, 1938, have been published in the "Treasury Bulletin." Data from inception to September 30, 1978, may be found on the statements published in the January 1979 "Treasury Bulletin."

INTRODUCTION: Airport and Airway Trust Fund

The Airport and Airway Trust Fund was established on the books of Treasury in fiscal year 1971, according to provisions of the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 [49 United States Code 1742(a), repealed]. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-248, dated September 3, 1982) reestablished the trust fund in the Internal Revenue Code (26 United States Code 9502) effective September 1, 1982.

Treasury transfers from the general fund to the trust fund amounts equivalent to the taxes received from transportation of persons and property by air, gasoline and jet fuel used in commercial and noncommercial aircraft, and an international arrival and departure tax. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508, dated November 5, 1990) increased rates for the excise taxes transferred to the fund.

Treasury bases these transfers on estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury. These are subject to adjustments in later transfers in the amount of actual tax receipts.

The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-35), effective October 1, 1997, extended the aviation excise taxes for 10 years. The Act included other provisions that:

Retained the existing freight waybill and general aviation fuel/gas taxes. It also retained a special rule applied to flights between the continental United States and Alaska or Hawaii. The $6 departure tax is indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Effective fiscal year 2003, the tax is $6.70.

Converted the 10 percent ad valorem tax on domestic passenger tickets to a combination of ad valorem/flight segment tax over 3 years, beginning October 1, 1997. Beginning October 1999 through September 30, 2007, the tax is 7.5 percent, plus in 2003, a $3.00 tax per segment.

Imposed a new 7.5 percent tax on payments to airlines for frequent flyer and similar awards by banks and

credit card companies, merchants and frequent flyer program partners, such as other airlines, hotels and rental car companies, and other businesses.

Increased the current $6 international departure tax to $12 per passenger and added a $12 international arrival tax, indexed to the Consumer Price Index. Effective 2003, the tax is $13.40.

Lowered tax rates on flights to certain rural airports to 7.5 percent without a flight segment component.

Transferred revenues from the 4.3 cents-per-gallon aviation fuel tax dedicated to reducing the national deficit from the general fund to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.

When the provisions of 26 United States Code 9602(b) are met, amounts available in the fund exceed outlay requirements, Treasury invests excess amounts in public debt securities and credits the interest to the fund. Additional sums from the general fund also are credited as authorized and made available, by law, if they are needed to meet outlay requirements.

Treasury makes available to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation (DOT), amounts required for outlays to carry out the Airport and Airway program. The Secretary of the Treasury makes other charges to the trust fund to transfer certain refunds of taxes and certain outfits, under section 34 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

Annual reports to Congress, required by 26 U.S.C. 9602 (a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund

The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1993, according to provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 United States Code 2297g). Receipts represent (1) fees collected from domestic public utilities based on their pro rata share of purchases of separative work units from the Department of Energy (DOE) and (2) appropriations toward the Government contribution based on the balance of separative work unit purchases.

Expenditures from the fund are for the purpose of (1) decontamination and decommissioning of the three gaseous diffusion plants, (2) remedial actions and related environmental restoration costs at the gaseous diffusion plants, and (3) reimbursement to uranium/thorium producers for the costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and remedial action of uranium/thorium sites that are incident to sales to the U.S. Government.

Amounts available in the fund exceeding current needs may be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of the United States (1) having maturities congruent with the needs of the fund and (2) bearing interest at rates determined appropriate, taking into consideration the

current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to these investments.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required by 42 United States Code 2297g(b)(1) to provide an annual report to Congress, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy. This report must present the financial condition and the results of operations of the fund during the preceding fiscal year.

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 United States Code 2297g-1, as amended) authorizes funding to ensure annual deposits to the fund of $518.2 million before adjustments for inflation. The Act stipulates that the Government deposit $369.6 million, adjusted for inflation, annually. The Act also calls for deposits of $150 million from domestic public utility assessments. Between the fiscal years of 1993 and 2003, the total Government contribution amount authorized by the Act was $4,262.5 million. During that time span, the Government contributed only $3,555.5 million to the fund. The resulting shortfall in authorized Government contributions is, therefore, $707.0 million.

INTRODUCTION: Black Lung Disability Trust Fund

The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1978 according to the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-227). The Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-119) reestablished the fund in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), 26 United States Code 9501.

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272), enacted April 7, 1986, provided for an increase in the coal tax rates effective April 1, 1986, through December 31, 1995, and a 5-year forgiveness of interest retroactive to October 1, 1985. The 5-year moratorium on interest payments ended on September 30, 1990. Payment of interest on advances resumed in fiscal year 1991. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-203, title X, section 10503), signed December 22, 1987, extends the temporary increase in the coal tax through December 31, 2013.

The Code designates the following receipts to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund: excise taxes on coal sold; taxable expenditures of self-dealing by, and excess contributions to, private black lung benefit trusts; reimbursements by responsible mine operators; and related fines, penalties and interest charges.

Estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury determine monthly transfers of amounts for excise taxes to the trust fund subject to adjustments in later transfers to actual tax receipts.

After retirement of the current indebtedness, amounts available in the fund exceeding current expenditure requirements will be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing public debt securities. Any interest earned will be credited to the fund. Also credited, if necessary, will be repayable advances from the general fund to meet outlay requirements exceeding available revenues.

To carry out the program, amounts are made available to the Department of Labor (DOL). Also charged to the fund are administrative expenses incurred by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Treasury, repayments of advances from the general fund and interest on advances.

The Code requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual report to Congress after consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of HHS [26 United States Code 9602(a)]. The report must present the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and the expected condition and operations of the fund during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund

The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury on April 1, 1987, according to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662, November 17, 1986) (26 United States Code 9505).

Amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund are available as provided by appropriation acts for making expenditures to carry out section 210(a) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. The appropriations act for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for fiscal year 1995 (Public Law 103-331, September 28, 1994), section 339, waived collection of charges or tolls on the Saint Lawrence Seaway in accordance with section 13(b) of the Act of May 13, 1954 (as in effect on April 1, 1987). Legislation was passed in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182, section 683), which amends paragraph (3) of section 9505(c) of the IRC of 1986, to authorize payment of up to $5 million annually to Treasury for all expenses of administration incurred by the Treasury, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Commerce (Commerce) related to the administration of subchapter A of chapter 36 (relating to harbor maintenance tax). Section 201 of the Water

Resources Development Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-303) authorizes use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for construction of dredged material disposal facilities associated with the operation and maintenance of Federal navigation projects for commercial navigation.

A summary judgment issued October 25, 1995, by the United States Court of International Trade in the case United States Shoe Corp. v. United States (Court No. 94-11-00668) found the Harbor Maintenance fee unconstitutional under the Export Clause of the Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 5) and enjoined the Customs Service from collecting the fee.

The decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court on March 31, 1998 (118 Supreme Court 1290). With the tax on exports no longer collected, revenues have been reduced by approximately 30 percent.

The Code requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual report to Congress [26 United States Code 9602(a)]. The report must present the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and the expected condition and operations of the fund during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Hazardous Substance Superfund

The Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1981, in accordance with section 221 of the Hazardous Substance Response Revenue Act of 1980 [42 United States Code 9631(a), repealed]. The trust fund was renamed the Hazardous Substance Superfund (Superfund) and relocated in accordance with section 517 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 [Public Law 99-499, dated October 17, 1986 (26 United States Code 9507)].

The authority to collect excise taxes on petroleum and

chemicals, and an environmental tax for all corporations with modified alternative taxable income in excess of $2 million, expired in 1995. To implement the Superfund program, amounts are appropriated from the Superfund to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for programmatic and administrative expenses.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of Treasury is required by 26 United States Code 9602(a). These reports present the financial condition of the Superfund and the results of operation for the past fiscal year, and its expected condition during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Highway Trust Fund

The Highway Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1957, according to provisions of the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (Act of June 29, 1956, chapter 462, section 209). It has been amended and extended by various highway, surface transportation and other acts since 1959. Section 9002 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) (Public Law 105-178) extended the Highway Trust Fund through September 30, 2003, and has been extended for 5 months under the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2005.

Amounts equivalent to taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuels, certain tires, heavy trucks and trailers, and heavy vehicle use are designated by the Act to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund. These transfers are made twice monthly based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to later adjustments to reflect the amount of actual tax receipts. Amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in non-interest-bearing public debt securities.

Within the fund is a mass transit account, funded by a portion of the excise tax collections under sections 4041 and 4081 of the IRC (title 26 United States Code). The funds from this account are used for expenditures in accordance

with section 5338 of title 49 United States Code, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240), or the TEA-21. The remaining excise taxes are included in a separate account within the trust fund commonly referred to as the highway account. Expenditures from this account are made according to the provisions of various transportation acts.

Amounts required for outlays to carry out the eligible surface transportation programs are made available to the responsible operating administrations within the Department of Transportation. Other charges to the trust fund are made by the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer of certain taxes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. Funds also are transferred to the general fund of the Treasury for the payment of tax refunds.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, is required to submit annual reports to Congress by section 9602(a) of title 26 United States Code. These reports cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund for the past fiscal year and expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Inland Waterways Trust Fund

The Inland Waterways Trust Fund was established by the Treasury in fiscal year 1984, pursuant to section 203 of the Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-502) and continued pursuant to section 1405 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662, codified at 26 United States Code 9506). Under 26 United States Code 9506(b), amounts from taxes on fuel used in commercial transportation on inland waterways, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, are appropriated to the trust fund.

The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-647, approved November 10, 1988) increased the tax each year, 1990 through 1995. These amounts are transferred quarterly from the general fund based on estimates made by the Secretary, subject to adjustments in later transfers to the amounts of actual tax receipts.

The Secretary of the Treasury invests in interest-bearing obligations of the United States that portion of the trust fund in his judgment, not required to meet current withdrawals. The interest on, and proceeds from, the sale or redemption of any obligation held in the trust fund is credited to the trust fund. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-502) provides that amounts in the trust fund shall be available as provided, by appropriations acts, for construction and rehabilitation expenditures for navigation on the inland and intracoastal waterways of the United States described in 33 United States Code 1804. Expenditures must be otherwise authorized by law.

Annual reports to Congress are required by 26 United States Code 9602(a) to be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and the results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund

The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund was established in fiscal year 1981 according to provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-510, codified at 26 United States Code 9508), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Re-authorizatiion Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-499, dated October 17, 1986), sections 13163(c) and 13242(d)(42) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66, dated August 10, 1993), and section 1032(e)(13) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1987 (Public Law 105-34, dated August 5, 1997).

The LUST Trust Fund is financed by taxes collected on gasoline, diesel fuels, special motor fuels, aviation fuels and fuels used in commercial transportation on inland

waterways. Amounts available in the LUST Trust Fund, exceeding current expenditure requirements, are invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing Government securities (e.g., Treasury bills). All interest earned is credited directly to the LUST Trust Fund.

To carry out the LUST program, amounts are appropriated for the LUST Trust Fund to the EPA for programmatic and administrative expenses.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury is required by 26 United States Code 9602(a). These reports present the financial condition of the LUST Trust Fund and results of operations for the past fiscal year and its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Nuclear Waste Fund

The Nuclear Waste Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1983, according to section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 [Public Law 97-425, codified at 42 United States Code 10222(c)]. Receipts represent fees collected from public utilities based on electricity generated by nuclear power reactors and spent nuclear fuel. Expenditures from the fund are for purposes of radioactive waste disposal activities.

Amounts available in the fund exceeding current needs may be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of the United States (1) having maturities in tandem with the needs of the waste fund and (2) bearing interest at rates determined appropriate, taking into

consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the maturities of such investments, except that the interest rate on such investments shall not exceed the average interest rate applicable to existing borrowings.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE), is required by 42 United States Code 10222(e)(1). This report must present the financial condition and the results of operations of the waste fund during the preceding fiscal year.

INTRODUCTION: Reforestation Trust Fund

The Reforestation Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal year 1981 to continue through September 30, 1985, according to provisions of Title III—Reforestation, of the Recreational Boating Safety and Facilities Improvement Act of 1980 [Public Law 96-451, codified at 16 United States Code 1606a(a)].

The act provides that the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to the trust fund tariffs, limited to not more than $30 million for any fiscal year, received in the Treasury from October 1, 1979, through September 30, 1985, on (1) rough and primary wood products and wood waste; (2) lumber, flooring and moldings; and (3) wood veneers, plywood, other wood-veneer assemblies and building boards. Public Law 99-190, title II, 99 Statutes at Large 1245, extended the receipts for the trust fund. Amounts available in the reforestation trust fund exceeding current withdrawals are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States

or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations are credited to the trust fund.

The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture is authorized to obligate available sums in the trust fund (including any amounts not obligated in previous years) for (1) reforestation and timber stand improvement and (2) administrative costs of the Government for these activities.

Annual reports are required by 16 United States Code 1606a(c) (1) to be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, on the financial condition and the results of the operations of the trust fund during the past fiscal year and on its expected condition and operations during the next fiscal year.

INTRODUCTION: Aquatic Resources Trust Fund

The Aquatic Resources Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury pursuant to the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 [Public Law 98-369, division A, title X, section 1016(a), approved July 18, 1984]. The fund consists of two accounts: the Sport Fish Restoration Account and Boat Safety Account.

Amounts equivalent to the excise taxes received on sport fishing equipment and import duties on fishing tackle, yachts, and pleasure craft are appropriated into the Sport Fish Restoration Account. Motorboat fuel taxes are transferred from the Highway Trust Fund to the Boat Safety Account. The amount transferred during any fiscal year cannot exceed $70 million. No amount is transferred if the transfer would result in increasing the balance in the Boat Safety Account to more than $70 million.

Any amounts in excess of $70 million for motorboat fuel taxes are transferred from the Highway Trust Fund to the Sport Fish Restoration Account. Authority for such transfers expires on October 1, 2005. Transfers of motorboat fuel taxes from the Highway Trust Fund to the Land and Water Conservation Fund are limited to $1 million per fiscal year. In addition, pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 [Public Law 101-508, title XI, section 11211(i)(2) and (3)], small engine gasoline taxes are transferred to the Sport Fish Restoration Account.

Amounts in the Sport Fish Restoration Account are used, as provided by appropriations acts, for the purposes of carrying out “An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the States in fish restoration and management projects, and for other purposes,” approved August 9, 1950 (as in effect on the date of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) Restoration Act), the purposes of section 7404(d) of the Transportation Equity for the 21st Century (as in effect on the date of enactment of the TEA-21 Restoration Act), and the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (as in effect on the date of enactment of the TEA-21 Restoration Act).

Amounts in the Boat Safety Account, as provided by appropriations acts, are available to carry out the purposes of section 13106 of title 46, United States Code (as in effect on the date of enactment of the TEA-21 Restoration Act).

When the provisions of 26 United States Code 9602(b) are met, amounts available in the two accounts exceeding outlay requirements are invested in public debt securities with the interest credited to the respective accounts.

Annual reports to Congress, required by 26 United States Code 9602(a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund

The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was established on the books of the Treasury by section 8033 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-509).

Amounts equivalent to the taxes received from the environmental tax on petroleum, but only to the extent of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund rate, are appropriated to the fund. The tax is not applied during any calendar quarter if the Secretary of the Treasury estimates that, as of the close of the preceding calendar quarter, the unobligated balance in the fund exceeds $1 billion.

Certain amounts were transferred from other funds and were appropriated to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund as

provided by 26 United States Code 9509(b). Certain paid penalties and amounts recovered for damages are also appropriated to the fund.

Amounts in the fund are available for oil spill cleanup costs and certain other related purposes as provided by appropriations acts or section 6002(b) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-380).

When the provisions of 26 United States Code 9602(b) are met, amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in public debt securities. Interest is credited to the fund.

Annual reports to Congress, required by 26 United States Code 9602(a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

Glossary

Accrued discount (SBN-1, -2, -3)—Interest that accumulates on savings bonds from the date of purchase until the date of redemption or final maturity, whichever comes first. Series A, B, C, D, E, EE, F, I, and J are discount or accrual type bonds—meaning principal and interest are paid when bonds are redeemed. Series G, H, HH, and K are current-income bonds, and the semiannual interest paid to their holders is not included in accrued discount.

Amounts outstanding and in circulation (USCC)—Includes all issues by the Bureau of the Mint purposely intended as a medium of exchange. Coins sold by the Bureau of the Mint at premium prices are excluded; however, uncirculated coin sets sold at face value plus handling charge are included.

Average discount rate (PDO-2, -3)—In Treasury bill auctions, purchasers tender competitive bids on a discount rate basis. The average discount rate is the weighted, or adjusted, average of all bids accepted in the auction.

Budget authority ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Congress passes laws giving budget authority to Government entities, which gives the agencies the power to spend Federal funds. Congress can stipulate various criteria for the spending of these funds. For example, Congress can stipulate that a given agency must spend within a specific year, number of years, or any time in the future.

The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, authority to borrow, contract authority, and authority to obligate and expend offsetting receipts and collections. The period of time during which Congress makes funds available may be specified as 1-year, multiple-year, or no-year. The available amount may be classified as either definite or indefinite; a specific amount or an unspecified amount can be made available. Authority also may be classified as current or permanent. Permanent authority requires no current action by Congress.

Budget deficit—The total, cumulative amount by which budget outlays (spending) exceed budget receipts (income).

Cash management bills (PDO-2)—Marketable Treasury bills of irregular maturity lengths, sold periodically to fund short-term cash needs of Treasury. Their sale, having higher minimum and multiple purchase requirements than those of other issues, is generally restricted to competitive bidders.

Competitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—A bid to purchase a stated amount of one issue of Treasury securities at a specified yield or discount. The bid is accepted if it is within the range accepted in the auction. (See Noncompetitive tenders.)

Coupon issue—The issue of bonds or notes (public debt).

Currency no longer issued (USCC)—Old and new series gold and silver certificates, Federal Reserve notes, national bank notes, and 1890 Series Treasury notes.

Current income bonds (“U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes”)—Bonds paying semiannual interest to holders. Interest is not included in accrued discount.

Debt outstanding subject to limitation (FD-6)—The debt incurred by the Treasury subject to the statutory limit set by Congress. Until World War I, a specific amount of debt was authorized to each separate security issue. Beginning with the Second Liberty Loan Act of 1917, the nature of the limitation was modified until, in 1941, it developed into an overall limit on the outstanding Federal debt. As of December 2003, the debt limit was $7,384,000 million; the limit may change from year to year.

The debt subject to limitation includes most of Treasury's public debt except securities issued to the Federal Financing Bank, upon which there is a limitation of $15 billion, and certain categories of older debt (totaling approximately $595 million as of February 1991).

Discount—The interest deducted in advance when purchasing notes or bonds. (See Accrued discount.)

Discount rate (PDO-2)—The difference between par value and the actual purchase price paid, annualized over a 360-day year. Because this rate is less than the actual yield (coupon-equivalent rate), the yield should be used in any comparison with coupon issue securities.

Dollar coins (USCC)—Include standard silver and nonsilver coins.

Domestic series (FD-2)—Nonmarketable, interest- and non-interest-bearing securities issued periodically by Treasury to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RFC) for investment of funds authorized under section 21B of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 United States Code 1441b).

Federal intrafund transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Intrabudgetary transactions in which payments and receipts both occur within the same Federal fund group (Federal funds or trust funds).

Federal Reserve notes (USCC)—Issues by the U.S. Government to the public through the Federal Reserve banks and their member banks. They represent money owed by the Government to the public. Currently, the item “Federal Reserve notes—amounts outstanding” consists of new series

Also refers to persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting for foreigners.

Foreign official institutions ("Capital Movements")—Includes central governments of foreign countries, including all departments and agencies of national governments; central banks, exchange authorities, and all fiscal agents of foreign national governments that undertake activities similar to those of a treasury, central bank, or stabilization fund; diplomatic and consular establishments of foreign national governments; and any international or regional organization, including subordinate and affiliate agencies, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states.

Foreign public borrower ("Capital Movements")—Includes foreign official institutions, as defined above, the corporations and agencies of foreign central governments, including development banks and institutions, and other agencies that are majority-owned by the central government or its departments; and state provincial and local governments of foreign countries and their departments and agencies.

Foreign-targeted issue (PDO-1, -3)—Foreign-targeted issues were notes sold between October 1984 and February 1986 to foreign institutions, foreign branches of U.S. institutions, foreign central banks or monetary authorities, or to international organizations in which the United States held membership. Sold as companion issues, they could be converted to domestic (normal) Treasury notes with the same maturity and interest rates. Interest was paid annually.

Fractional coins (USCC)—Coins minted in denominations of 50, 25, and 10 cents, and minor coins (5 cents and 1 cent).

Government account series (FD-2)—Certain trust fund statutes require the Secretary of the Treasury to apply monies held by these funds toward the issuance of nonmarketable special securities. These securities are sold directly by Treasury to a specific Government agency, trust fund, or account. Their rate is based on an average of market yields on outstanding Treasury obligations, and they may be redeemed at the option of the holder. Roughly 80 percent of these are issued to five holders: the Federal Old-age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; the civil service retirement and

disability fund; the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the military retirement fund; and the Unemployment Trust Fund.

Interfund transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Transactions in which payments are made from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in another group.

International Monetary Fund (“Exchange Stabilization Fund,” IFS-1)—(IMF) Established by the United Nations, the IMF promotes international trade, stability of exchange, and monetary cooperation. Members are allowed to draw from the fund.

Intrabudgetary transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—These occur when payment and receipt both occur within the budget, or when payment is made from off-budget Federal entities whose budget authority and outlays are excluded from the budget totals.

Matured non-interest-bearing debt (SBN-1, -2, -3)—The value of outstanding savings bonds and notes that have reached final maturity and no longer earn interest. Includes all Series A-D, F, G, I, J, and K bonds. Series E bonds (issued between May 1941 and November 1965), Series EE (issued since January 1980), Series H (issued from June 1952 through December 1979), and savings notes issued between May 1967 and October 1970 have a final maturity of 30 years. Series HH bonds (issued since January 1980) mature after 20 years.

Noncompetitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations"—Offers by an investor to purchase Treasury securities at the price equivalent to the weighted average discount rate or yield of accepted competitive tenders in a Treasury auction. Noncompetitive tenders are always accepted in full.

Obligations (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—An unpaid commitment to acquire goods or services.

Off-budget Federal entities ("Federal Fiscal Operations")— Federally owned and controlled entities whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals under provisions of law. Their receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit are not included in budget receipts, outlays, or deficits. Their budget authority is not included in totals of the budget.

Outlays ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Payments on obligations in the form of cash, checks, the issuance of bonds or notes, or the maturing of interest coupons.

Own foreign offices ("Capital Movements")—Refers to U.S. reporting institutions' parent organizations, branches and/or majority-owned subsidiaries located outside the United States.

Quarterly financing (“Treasury Financing Operations”)—Treasury has historically offered packages of several

138

GLOSSARY

"coupon" security issues on the 15th of February, May, August, and November, or on the next working day. These issues currently consist of a 3-year note, a 10-year note, and a 30-year bond. Treasury sometimes offers additional amounts of outstanding long-term notes or bonds, rather than selling new security issues. (See Reopening.)

Receipts ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Funds collected from selling land, capital, or services, as well as collections from the public (budget receipts), such as taxes, fines, duties, and fees.

Reopening (PDO-3, -4)—The offer for sale of additional amounts of outstanding issues, rather than an entirely new issue. A reopened issue will always have the same maturity date, CUSIP-number, and interest rate as the original issue.

Special drawing rights ("Exchange Stabilization Fund," IFS-1)—International assets created by IMF that serve to increase international liquidity and provide additional international reserves. SDRs may be purchased and sold among eligible holders through IMF. (See IMF.)

SDR allocations are the counterpart to SDRs issued by IMF based on members' quotas in IMF. Although shown in Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) statements as liabilities, they must be redeemed by ESF only in the event of liquidation of, or U.S. withdrawal from, the SDR department of IMF or cancellation of SDRs.

SDR certificates are issued to the Federal Reserve System against SDRs when SDRs are legalized as money. Proceeds of monetization are deposited into an ESF account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Spot (“Foreign Currency Positions”)—Due for receipt or delivery within 2 workdays.

State and local government series (FD-2)—(SLUGs) Special nonmarketable certificates, notes, and bonds offered to State and local governments as a means to invest proceeds

from their own tax-exempt financing. Interest rates and maturities comply with IRS arbitrage provisions. SLUGs are offered in both time deposit and demand deposit forms. Time deposit certificates have maturities of up to 1 year. Notes mature in 1 to 10 years and bonds mature in more than 10 years. Demand deposit securities are 1-day certificates rolled over with a rate adjustment daily.

Statutory debt limit (FD-6)—By Act of Congress there is a limit, either temporary or permanent, on the amount of public debt that may be outstanding. When this limit is reached, Treasury may not sell new debt issues until Congress increases or extends the limit. For a detailed listing of changes in the limit since 1941, see the Budget of the United States Government. (See debt outstanding subject to limitation.)

STRIPS (PDO-1, -3)—Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Long-term notes and bonds may be divided into principal and interest-paying components, which may be transferred and sold in amounts as small as $1,000. STRIPS are sold at auction at a minimum par amount, varying for each issue. The amount is an arithmetic function of the issue’s interest rate.

Treasury bills—The shortest term Federal security (maturity dates normally varying from 3 to 12 months), are sold at a discount.

Trust fund transaction (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—An intrabudgetary transaction in which both payments and receipts occur within the same trust fund group.

United States—Includes the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Midway Island, Virgin Islands, Wake Island, and all other territories and possessions.
