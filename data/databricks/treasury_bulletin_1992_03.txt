New OECD Tied Aid Agreement Expected to Benefit U.S. Exporters Says Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade and Investment Policy William E. Barreda

On February 15, 1992, a new agreement on tied aid credits was implemented within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

"The new rules are an innovative attempt to reduce trade distortions that arise when aid financing crowds out commercial financing in certain types of development projects," said Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trade and Investment Policy William E. Barreda in an exclusive interview. The new agreement encourages competition based on price, quality, and service rather than financing subsidies.

"The problem we had in the past is that it was possible to use an aid program as an export promotion device," said the Deputy Assistant Secretary, who has negotiating the new agreement over the past 2-1/2 years." Export subsidies are generally prohibited, except in agriculture, but aid is widely applauded," he said. "But if you gave aid to certain countries for one third of a plant and required that they buy the remaining two thirds from you commercially, prior to this agreement, you were within accepted trade rules."

"The new agreement prohibits tied aid funds, except those funds having at least an 80 percent subsidy, from competing with private financing and official export credits for projects that can pay their own way. The market should be financing these kinds of projects, unless the donor is prepared to virtually give away the equipment," he said. Other's use of aid funds to "sweeten" commercial deals has

hurt U.S. exporters and distorted trade. "What we've tried to do is draw the line between the types of projects that can be financed by tied aid and those that should get commercial financing," he continued. "A very good example of a purely aid project is a road. A road usually doesn't pay for itself, but it's good for the country as a whole. But an electrical power plant in an urban center can pay for itself—users can, and should pay the cost. That project should be left for the market. Market competition should determine which firm wins the contract.

"Another key discipline is to draw a line as to which countries are eligible for tied aid in the first place," the Deputy Assistant Secretary said. Countries with higher per capita income, including Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, are able to attract and afford sufficient private capital flows and are ineligible for tied aid credits under the new rules. Negotiations on the transition mechanism for these countries were underway at press time.The new agreement also sets up a dispute settlement mechanism.

"We hope by the application of these new rules, private capital flows will be maximized in the promotion of development and aid money will go to the best use. We expect that financially viable projects will be bid and awarded efficiently without financing subsidies," he said.. "Our goal is that aid will no longer substitute for private capital and distort trade."

NEW TIED AID RULES

For projects below a minimum concessionality level of 80 percent and credit above SDR 2 million the new rules would:

Bar tied aid to countries whose annual per capita income would make them ineligible for 17 or 20 year loans from the World Bank (per capita income $2,465 or above) with automatic graduation after 2 years above the line;

Attempt to draw a line between projects that can support financing on commercial terms and those that legitimately require aid funds that may be tied for those below $2,465 per capita income, but excluding the poorest countries (LLDCs). Financial viability at appropriate market-based prices and availability of market-related financing are tests;

Provide special consultation procedures for large projects (over SDR 50 million) with special weight to the availability of financing on commercial terms, for all countries where tied aid is not prohibited (including LLDCs).

Require 30 days prior notification to OECD export credit management participants for all tied, partially untied, and untied aid or concessional credits.

(Existing minimum concessionality levels required for all tied and partially untied concessional and aid credits.)

Dispute resolved within a comprehensive prior notification and consultation procedure that would:

Allow a participant to challenge a notification as not meeting the new rules. In cases where commercial viability is at issue, require the aid agency to show that the project would not be viable even if market prices were applied;

Require substantial support from other OECD members (the EC has one vote); validate the new view that project is not commercially viable and appropriate for tied aid;

Require for any subsequent derogation public explanation (on non-trade grounds absent such substantial support. Derogations expected to be unusual and infrequent and subject of a special annual report to OECD Ministers.

Subsidies reduced in standard export credits by:

Eliminating of eligibility of intermediate countries for arrangement average intere (matrix) rates;

Increasing the matrix interest rate for the relatively poorest countries by 30 basis points;

Setting the maximum 120 days hold on interest rate offers at a cost of 20 bp.

Work program will:

Examine matrix with view toward elimination for relatively poor countries and examine the appropriate discount rate (DDR) for meeting the minimum concessionality rules by the end of 1993;

Work with the Development Assistance Committee to develop targets for aid unty by the end of 1992;

Attempt to develop a better definition for de facto untied and partially untied aid.

Examine premiums and fees charged for official export credit insurance to eliminate any subsidies that may exist.

Director of the Office for Trade Finance William L. McCamey Explains New OECD Agreement to Congress

December 18, 1991, William L. McCamey, Director of the Office for Trade Finance, addressed the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the new agreement reached by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The agreement will reduce both the scope of tied aid as well as subsidies in standard export credits. The 22 countries that participated in the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits confirmed it December. The following was taken from Director McCamey's statement.

The new OECD agreement is another important step in the direction of encouraging competition on the basis of price, quality, and service rather than financing subsidies.

This agreement is the culmination of more than 2 years of intensive negotiations initiated by the United States. These negotiations responded to Eximbank's 1989 report to Congress on the tied aid practices of others, a similar Commerce department report last year, and concerns in the business community, Congress, and the Administration itself.

We began efforts to initiate negotiations in late 1989. A considerable portion of last year was devoted to gaining international agreement on the negotiating mandate and securing needed support at the political level, including that of both the OECD Ministerial and London Economic Summit.

Tied Aid Credit Problem

Tied aid is defined as concessional financing linked to procurement of goods and services in the donor country. Tied aid credits can stand alone or be mixed with commercial financing or standard official export credits. The latter are called mixed credits. The purpose of tied aid is to assist developing economies through softer financing terms while prompting or maintaining an adequate constituency in support of aid budget allocations in donor legislatures.

The trade distortion issue most often arises when tied aid is used in whole or part to finance capital projects. The availability of tied aid credits puts exporters from countries without equivalent access to such concessional financing at a distinct disadvantage in bidding on projects.

Once tied aid enters the picture, contract awards are often based not on the price or quality of the goods or service, but rather on the availability of subsidized financing. U.S. exporters utilizing commercial or Eximbank financing often cannot compete effectively with foreign firms that benefit from financing that includes tied aid credits. Eximbank estimated in its 1989 report to Congress that U.S.

capital goods exporters lost annual sales of $400-800 million as the result of the tied aid practices of others.

The New Agreement

The agreement confirmed recently sets up rules and procedures to determine when tied and partially untied concessional and aid credits are likely to distort trade and should not be extended. It also reduces subsidies in standard export credits.

Tied Aid Rules

The tied aid credits that potentially distort trade are defined for purposes of the new tied aid rules as those with a concessionality level less than 80 percent. Projects below a de minimis level of SDR 2 million are similarly excluded from the new disciplines.

One basic restraint of the new agreement provides that relatively wealthier countries will no longer be eligible for any tied aid credits. The new rules use World Bank categories to define relatively wealthy countries as those having an annual per capita income in excess of $2,465 in 1990. Furthermore, as middle-income countries grow, the agreement includes a provision to graduate them from eligibility for tied aid credits.

This new agreement exempts the very poorest countries (LLDCs) from the new disciplines because of their urgent

5

TREASURY ISSUES

need for concessional assistance, whether tied or untied. A high minimum concessionality level (50 percent) is already required when providing tied aid credits to them.

For countries in between the wealthier countries and LLDCs, the key rule limits tied aid credits for projects that should, with market-oriented pricing, be commercially viable and, therefore, able to be financed on commercial terms.

Such projects will, under the new rule, not normally be eligible for tied aid credits with a concessionality level below 80. percent unless financing--including official export credits--is not available on market-related terms.

Limiting tied aid for commercially viable projects is an attempt to replicate the efficient financing patterns of market economics. Projects inherently productive enough to service debt on market terms should be allocated capital on market terms, thereby saving scarce concessional assistance for projects that cannot attract and support such financing.

The availability of aid funds should not crowd out commercial financing. With strict adherence, this strategy should maximize the total flow of capital available for development and allocate it more efficiently.

The concept that tied aid credits should not finance inherently commercially viable projects was developed by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Since tied aid credits affect both trade and aid policies, the U.S. initiated parallel efforts in the Export Credit Arrangement forum and the DAC.

A third new rule provides for consultations on large projects. Tied aid offers for projects in excess of SDR 50 million will be subject to a special international consultation process aimed at maximizing the use of official export credits available on market-related terms.

Tied Aid Procedures

In addition to the new rules, the agreement institutes a comprehensive reporting and consultation process to increase the transparency of aid credit offers, and to interpret and enforce the rules.

All offers of tied aid, partially untied aid subject to the new rules, and untied aid, must be prior notified 30 working days before the earliest date-the bid closing date, or extending the financing offer. Any OECD Export Credit Arrangement participant may then challenge a notification as not meeting the new rules and/or not being effectively untied.

This will initiate a consultation procedure that will involve canvassing all Export Credit Arrangement participants as to whether the project should be permitted tied aid credits. The procedure can, at the discretion of the challenging participant, include a face-to-face meeting. If there is not "substantial support" for the use of tied aid, the country wishing to offer the credit will be asked not to go forward.

If the country decides to extend the offer anyway, it must notify the OECD Secretary General in writing as to the non-trade related imperative that requires such action. Such derogations from the rules are expected to be unusual and infrequent, and will be the subject of an annual report to OECD Ministers.

While some consultations may turn on political imperative, we expect consultations to occur primarily where there are differing views as to the commercial viability of an individual project.

The consultation process will thus be utilized to reconcile technical differences on borderline cases on a project-by-project basis. In so doing, a body of case law is expected to be developed that will guide aid agencies and official export credit agencies in the future toward projects that are suitable for their respective financing roles.

Standard Export Credits

The agreement also reduces remaining subsidies in standard export credits. Lending to middle-income countries (Category II countries in OECD Export Credit Arrangement terms) will be restricted to market-related interest rates (called commercial interest reference rates or CIRRs) rather than the matrix rates established in the Arrangement. The latter, which are based on an average of interest rates in major countries, may be below market rates, particularly for concurrence of high interest rate countries.

Matrix rates were earlier eliminated for wealthier (Cat I) countries. The matrix rates that remain available for the

6

TREASURY ISSUES

relatively poor countries (Cat III countries) will be increased (up to 30 basis points) to further reduce subsidies pending conclusion of a review to see whether market-related interest rates should be used for these countries also.

Future Work

The new agreement also includes a program for future work. As mentioned, the participants will be reviewing the arrangement matrix with a view toward its total elimination and placing sole reliance on market-related rates. The work program will entail development of a better definition of de facto untied aid. This should permit assessment of whether some untied aid should be subject to new rules as well.

Premiums and fees charged for official export credit insurance and guarantees will also be examined to eliminate any subsidies that may exist.

However, a major focus of our efforts in the next year or two will be on implementation of the new agreement. As we did following the 1987 agreement, we plan to use available War Chest funds in a defensive manner to ensure effective implementation of the agreement.

Central and Eastern Europe

In parallel with the tied-aid-credit negotiations, we pursued a separate agreement to keep Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) a tied aid-free zone.

That region emerged from communist control untainted by tied aid and with a large potential need for capital goods. In the absence of an agreement, economic and political pressure for tied aid inevitably would have built. Given the orientation of our own aid program, the introduction of tied aid credits would have put U.S. exporters at a severe disadvantage. At the instigation of the United States, Ministers at the June 1991 OECD meeting agreed to "try to avoid tied aid credits other than outright grants, food aid, and humanitarian aid into Central and Eastern Europe."

The new tied aid agreement recognized the separate Ministerial agreement. The Ministerial agreement has been holding, and we believe it important to U.S. industry to maintain it. We addressed the special needs of two countries in the region, Yugoslavia and Albania, in the agreement. It was agreed that Yugoslavia would not be graduated from eligibility for tied aid credits. When reliable per capita income statistics become available, it will be reclassified. Similarly, Albania is so poor, it remains eligible for tied aid.

Conclusion

The new tied aid/export credit agreement, which builds on and complements past agreements to reduce trade distortions from tied aid and further squeeze financing subsidies from official export credits:

Graduates wealthier countries from eligibility for tied aid.
Institutes a standard for extending or not extending tied aid credits and procedures for resolving differences.
Provides for scrutiny of untied aid credits.
Eliminates matrix interest rates for standard export credits to middle income developing countries in favor of market-related rates and initiates a review aimed at eliminating matrix rates altogether.
Reinforces the Ministerial agreement to refrain from spoiling the markets of Central and Eastern Europe with tied aid credits.

This provides a framework for making substantial progress on a complex issue made more difficult by virtue of divergent national views on the appropriate role of, and techniques for, extending aid. This is important in reconciling these views. It is our hope that over time, with experience, aid and export credit agencies will be able to distinguish, with increasing confidence and comfort, between the types of projects appropriate for aid financing and those that should be able to support commercial financing.

We believe this agreement will significantly reduce the disadvantage faced by U.S. exporters who have had to compete against foreign firms with access to concessional financing. It will not eliminate trade distorting aid practices. But it is our hope that it will permit U.S. business to compete more effectively by returning the emphasis of competition to price, quality, and service rather than financing subsidies.

The ultimate success of the agreement will depend on its implementation.

We will be working closely with Eximbank, AID, and other interested agencies to implement the agreement aggressively. In addition, we have been consulting closely with the business community during these negotiations and will continue to do so during implementation. Implementation, however, depends not only on the United States. We found during the negotiations a very considerable degree of acceptance that the new rules provide a sensible basis for allocating concessional resources that have become increasingly scarce. We expect to work closely with like-minded governments during the implementation process.

Foreign Participation in U.S. Futures Markets Grows

Michael Cayton, International Economist, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy

The following is the first report of its kind done by the Department of the Treasury about the scope of foreign participation in the U.S. futures market. Based on research and interviews with major pool organizers, this report was done in conjunction with the Foreign Portfolio Investment Survey. This report previews some of the information that will be included in the upcoming release of the complete survey.

One of the fastest growing segments of world securities markets is futures contracts. The data available from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the estimates derived from the sample of commodity "pool" organizers indicate that foreign participation in the U.S. futures markets is a significant portion of the total.

The major conclusion that emerges from this study is that the share of foreign interests, including those that can be imputed to participation in commodity pools, probably represents between 15 and 20 percent of the total outstanding contracts. With the value of the underlying contracts at the end of 1989 at almost $750 billion, foreign participation is sufficiently large to be an important factor in the determination of spot, as well as futures prices.

The subject of widespread misconceptions, these contracts represent obligations to buy or sell predetermined amounts of specified commodities, currencies, or financial instruments at a specific price and time in the future. As such, they should be clearly distinguished from actual ownership of the underlying commodities or instruments.

The value of a futures contract on a given commodity at a particular time is determined by the deviation of the futures price at that time from the specified contract price. The value of the contract can be either positive or negative. Normally it is much smaller than the value of the underlying commodities or financial instruments.

Historically, the futures markets were dominated by internationally important primary goods, particularly agricultural commodities such as cotton, wheat, and sugar. Later, especially during the 1970s, futures contracts were extended to cover major foreign currencies and a variety of financial instruments, such as Treasury bonds and bills, eurodollar deposits, and, more recently, stock exchange indices. Traditionally, producers and/major buyers of the underlying commodities would use futures contracts to hedge or lock in

prices in advance of their actual sales or purchases. But because futures prices are closely linked to spot or cash prices by arbitrage, futures contracts can serve as vehicles to invest in the underlying commodities or instruments.

The futures markets have grown explosively in recent years. The total volume of trading in contracts on U.S. markets increased from 74.2 million contracts in 1979 to 267.7 million in 1989--an average annual growth rate of 13.7 percent. Open interest (the total number of contracts outstanding at a given time) increased from 1.7 million to almost 3.2 million.

Most of the growth in the futures markets has come not in traditional contracts on agricultural and industrial commodities, but on foreign currencies and financial instruments, many of which were introduced only recently. The volume of trading in foreign currency and financial instruments showed a spectacular annual growth rate of almost 38 percent from 1979 through 1989. And the share of trading in such contracts in the total volume rose from 8.9 percent in 1979 to 60.7 percent in 1989.

The total value of the underlying assets represented by futures contracts on U.S. markets amounted to about $750 billion (See Table 1, page 9). Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) estimated the underlying value of financial and currency futures and futures options in all world markets at about $1.6 trillion.2 This compares with a value of all domestic and international bonds estimated at about $11 trillion. Clearly the futures markets, with their large size and close link with cash markets, are an important element in the international financial system.

As with the stock markets, foreign participation in U.S. futures markets may be either direct or indirect. Some foreigners participate directly. They buy or sell futures by maintaining their own accounts. Others participate indirectly—placing funds with others for management, generally through commodity pools (See Table 1 for data on direct foreign participation in the U.S. futures markets).

Total open interest in all futures contracts traded in U.S. markets amounted to over 3 million contracts, according to the CFTC, which requires all futures market positions above certain exemption levels to be reported. 3 Of these 3 million contracts, foreigners held almost 420,000 long contracts and

over 390,000 short contracts--roughly 14 percent of the total number of open contracts or open interest. Reported foreign long positions had an underlying value of about $114 billion, while short positions amounted to about $86 billion.

Moreover, due to exemption levels, these figures must understate the actual amount and shares of foreign participation to some degree.

In terms of underlying value, by far the largest category of foreign participation is in financial instruments. Especially large are futures contracts held by foreigners on 90-day eurodollar deposits. The open interest on these contracts amounted to almost $60 billion, with foreign long positions of $9.6 billion.

While partly due to the large contract size, the main factor in the high levels of the underlying values of the eurodollar futures is that they offer a means of hedging or betting on interest rate trends. Such trends are of decisive importance in world financial markets.

It is noteworthy that foreign positions in eurodollar futures are heavily on the long side. This may partly reflect their usage in locking in future interest rates on existing cash eurodollar deposits.

In terms of numbers of contracts and shares of open interest, however, the largest category of foreign participation is in the more trditional area of agricultural commodities. While foreigners hold positions on both sides of the market, they hold more short positions than long.

The large short positions probably represent hedging by foreign producers. This is supported by the data broken down between commercial and noncommercial positions: among reporters identified as commercial, short positions predominate. Meanwhile, long positions are much larger among the noncommercial reporters (See Table 2, page 11).

Foreigners are mainly long in foreign currencies. Seemingly paradoxical, this may reflect the fact that a large proportion of the world's cash instruments are denominated in dollars, often because of superior convenience and liquidity. Foreign currency futures essentially provide a means of diversifying or converting these dollar instruments into other currencies.

TREASURY ISSUES

A notable exception to the predominance of long positions among foreigners is the Canadian dollar, where short positions predominated.

This may reflect decisions by Canadians effectively to convert their Canadian dollar holdings into U.S. dollars.

Interestingly, foreign positions in gold futures are also slightly on the long side. While commercial positions are heavily short, they are more than offset by long positions in private noncommercial accounts. This again may illustrate the use of futures to diversify portfolio holdings, in this case with gold positions.

Data by country (see Table 2) show that world financial centers predominate in foreign holdings in U.S. futures contracts. The United Kingdom by itself accounts for almost 30 percent of both short and long positions.

The top seven countries by numbers of contracts-Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom--account for more than 75 percent of outstanding foreign contracts. The high leveraging involved in futures markets makes communication extremely

important for traders. Hence, it is not surprising that most futures trading is done from countries with sophisticated financial centers. The country in which futures transactions are made, however, may not reflect the true ownership of futures positions.

In many cases, the large financial centers may serve as intermediaries for traders from countries having less sophisticated financial centers. This would obscure the actual nationality or residence of the ultimate holders of the futures contracts.

On the other hand, the strong predominance of long positions in Hong Kong and Japan, especially for agricultural and industrial commodities, does suggest that a significant number of these positions represent direct use of the futures markets for hedging commercial and industrial positions in those two countries.

Nonresident positions held by governmental agencies are much smaller than private sector positions. It is entirely possible, however, that some governmental positions are not picked up in the data because they are held through separate trading entities or are otherwise concealed.

TREASURY ISSUES

Reported governmental positions are much less concentrated, compared to private sector positions, in the major financial countries. This is not surprising. Private investors are more likely to locate trading in the major financial centers, as private investors see more flexibility in the location of their trading headquarters

But the reduced overhead associated with the use of major financial centers is probably also a greater factor for private investors, whose investments are generally on a smaller scale than those of governmental sectors.

For both the governmental and private sectors, positions classified as commercial far outweigh those listed as noncommercial. While this is meant to distinguish hedging from "speculative" contracts, the dividing line between the two is often unclear.

Where there is some doubt, it seems likely that more reporters would classify their positions as commercial. However, the fact that short positions are more common among those reporting as commercial, whereas long positions are more heavily represented among the noncommercial reporters does give some support to the classifications. On this basis, hedging positions probably are in fact substantially more common than speculative or investment positions among nonresidents.

While direct foreign participation reported in Tables 1 and 2 is important, it would not include most indirect participation through commodity pools or individual accounts.

Foreign funds placed with professional money managers generally would not be identified as being foreign in the data. This is because the manager or pool operator would usually be a U.S. resident.

Such indirect participation has become increasingly important. By placing funds with a professional money manager, foreign investors can avoid the otherwise daunting problems of information and communications. Moreover, the professional expertise can be important to both domestic and foreign investors in the futures markets-markets that are volatile and frequently treacherous, with both large profits and losses being common. Both of these factors have favored the growth of managed funds.

Of particular importance are the pooled funds. By utilizing pooled funds, investors can avoid the substantial administrative costs and complications of trading individual accounts. The pools, conceptually equivalent to mutual

equity funds, often are put together by large brokerage institutions and may be privately or publicly offered. The private pools are often organized as limited partnerships, with initial subscriptions by investors and limited provisions for withdrawals or additions.

Public funds, on the other hand, provide greater flexibility to investors, though they often involve higher commission costs. Both types of pools can and do attract foreign participation.

Some pools are organized exclusively as offshore pools. They are legally restricted to nonresident participation, even though they are typically managed by U.S.-based commodity pool operators (CPOs).

Such pools incur much less stringent registration and regulatory requirements than onshore pools. For this reason, they are very attractive for pool organizers.

The number of the pools and the amounts of money under management have burgeoned over the last 10 years. Reliable data are available only for those pools registered with the National Futures Association (NFA). The data exclude some small domestic funds as well as some portion of offshore funds, both small and large.

In 1979, there were 45 publicly offered futures funds registered with the NFA. Of the 45, only 12 were under active management, with asset holdings of about $125 million. By the end of 1989, the number of public funds had grown to 140--with almost $2.4 billion under management.

At the same time, registered private funds numbered about 450, and managed something around $5.9 billion. In addition, there are unregistered private funds, as well as individual accounts under management.

A private research group estimates that the total amount of funds under management grew from about $0.5 billion to $10-12 billion in the 1980s.

The data available from the NFA do not identify offshore pools as such, and some portion of the offshore pools are not registered at all. Furthermore, some portion of the funds in onshore pools actually derives from foreign sources.

In order to obtain a rough estimate of the amount of possible foreign participation, informal discussions were held with major pool organizers.7 Of the approximately $4.9 billion in pools organized by those questioned, almost 40 percent

11

TREASURY ISSUES

--or nearly $2 billion--represented foreign money--the preponderant share in offshore pools.

Together with the funds under management in individual accounts, total foreign funds under management by U.S.-based advisors would probably total between $2.5 and $3 billion.

It also appears that this is the fastest growing segment of the industry. Several of those polled indicated that current marketing efforts were being devoted to raising funds for offshore pools, partly because of the less stringent registration requirements. Because of the strong leveraging inherent in futures positions, pool managers typically employ only 20 to 30 percent of their total capital at any given time in meeting margin requirements. The rest is normally maintained in highly liquid money market assets, such as eurodollar deposits. Accordingly, the estimated $2.5 to $3 billion in foreign funds under management in futures accounts might generate $500 to $900 million in futures margins and over $2 billion in short-term cash assets.

It is impossible to calculate the number of contracts and the underlying value of the instruments reflected by this size margin, since values would vary with the types of contracts. However, it probably would represent, at a minimum, more than 200,000 contracts. On the basis of the average contract value as of end-1989, this would amount to an underlying

value of about $50 billion, sufficient to have an important influence on market prices.

1 For example, if the current or "spot" price of gold is $400 per ounce, then the owner of 100 ounces of gold would have an asset with a market value of $40,000. But a futures contract for the purchase of 100 ounces of gold, e.g. for delivery in 6 months, with a price of $400 per ounce, would have a value determined by the deviation of the futures price from $400 per ounce. If the futures price of gold rose to $450 per ounce, then the contract would have a current market value of $5000 (i.e., $50 x 100). If the futures price fell to $350 per ounce, then the contract purchaser would have a loss of $5,000, as the obligation to buy at $400 per ounce would mean a loss of $50 per ounce.
2 Bank for International Settlements, Annual Report 1989/90, Basle, Switzerland, 1990, p.147.
3 The reports are filed by futures commission merchants, clearing members, and foreign brokers. The account exemption levels are relatively high. For example, the reportable level for U.S. Treasury bond futures is 300 contracts, each of which represents $100,000 face value; thus, a reportable bond position would represent an underlying bond position with a face value of $30 million. The exemption levels reflect in part the fact that a primary purpose in the reporting is to monitor possible market abuses, such as efforts by individuals or traders to manipulate prices.
4 Subtracting the short from the long positions is not very meaningful here, since ownership is not an issue. A net long position in aggregate would mean simply that as of Dec. 31, 1989, the commitments by foreigners to buy were larger, in value terms, than the commitments by foreigners to sell.
5 CPOs who solicit funds in the United States must be registered with the NFA and the CFTC and must submit reports to those organizations. CPOs having offshore funds exclusively need not be registered and their operations would not be counted. However, many of the offshore pools, probably representing the preponderant portion of the funds invested, are actually managed by U.S.-based "commodity trading advisors," who manage onshore pools as well and who must report to the NFA. It seems likely, therefore, that the funds reported to the NFA represent well over 50 percent of the total offshore pools.

The Secretary of the Treasury Discusses the President's Economic Proposals

On February 4, 1992, Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady addressed the House Committee on Ways and Means concerning the economic proposals announced by President Bush in his State of the Union address and detailed in the President's budget for fiscal 1993. The following is a summary of that address.

The President's actions and proposals will accelerate economic recovery in the short term, stimulate the nation's long-term economic growth, and increase the competitiveness of American goods and services in the world economy.

The President's comprehensive program for growth includes initiatives beyond those I will discuss here. For example, his program supports record Federal investment in research and development (R&D), in Head Start and children generally, in education, in crime, in drug abuse, and in preventive health.

In addition, the President's program, Job Training 2000, will improve the delivery and effectiveness of job training and vocational education. Meanwhile, his proposal to combine law enforcement and social services is designed to reinvigorate impoverished and embattled communities.

When enacted by Congress, the President's plan will expand opportunity and enhance the nation's standard of living. The President's tax proposals are specifically addressed to the fundamental economic concerns of American families.

Many factors have coalesced to make the economic recovery sluggish. We experienced a Mideast crisis and a war, during which oil prices rose to over $40 a barrel. We have had 2-1/2 years of restrictive, high interest rates that only recently have abated. The nation's businesses and its families and Government borrowed too much. And, unfortunately, improving the climate for increased jobs and investment has not been a congressional priority.

Some Encouraging Signs

Nevertheless, there are encouraging signs. American corporations and families have moved to pay down their debt burden. Also, the spiral of rising prices has been halted. Families need no longer fear that run-away inflation will rob them of their purchasing power. (See Charts T1-A and T1-B.)

And, American businesses do not have to worry that rapid increases will render American products noncompetitive in world markets. American exports are strong, and business inventories lean. Interest rates are

now the lowest in 20 years. The decline in interest rates could, in 1992, save American families as much as $25 billion in interest on mortgages and other household debt.

Lower interest rates also should mean a savings of about $10 billion for American corporations. Federal, State, and local governments will save another $10 billion.

All of this has occurred against the backdrop of the end of the Cold War, an economic stimulus that none of us can now calculate, but that will be of enormous proportions.

The American People Want Action

But positive signals are only the beginning. The American people remain concerned about the strength of their nation's economy.

People who have worked in industries or companies that have contracted want to be confident that they can find new jobs and, if necessary, shift careers.

Families who own no home want to be sure that they will someday. And homeowners hope to see strength in the value of their houses--their most valuable assets.

American families deserve to be confident about their children's future, the quality and safety of their children's schools, and their ability to afford the education necessary to raise their children's and grandchildren's standard of living.

The public is entitled to assurance about the soundness of the financial institutions on which they have long depended for help and security. Witnessing the failure of a savings and loan or bank where you or your neighbors have saved and borrowed is extremely unsettling. The country worries that American banks, which for so long were

13

TREASURY ISSUES

dominant in the world, are now overshadowed by foreign banks. Small businesses and other investors have had difficulty obtaining loans they need to expand their businesses and create jobs.

And Congress so far has refused to modernize the legal framework governing banks that was designed decades ago for a totally different economic era.

The American people deserve to be certain of our ability to compete in the new global economy. They demand that we maintain our advantage of superior technology and our capacity for stunning innovation.

Economic Growth Is the Engine of Progress

There is only one response that we, Congress, and the President working together, can make to fulfill the hopes of the American people. We should move at once to enact into law the President's proposals that will accelerate economic recovery. We must demonstrate an unwavering commitment to creating an environment for sustained growth over the long term. Over time, gains in family income depend upon improved national productivity.

Only sustained economic growth can improve the incomes of wage-earning men and women; only sustained economic growth will provide the resources to feed and house the poor, and guarantee health care to all Americans.

And only sustained economic growth--not higher tax rates--will increase the resources of Federal, State, and local governments. There should be no misunderstanding about this important point.

A 1 percent decrease in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 1992 alone could decrease Federal Government receipts by nearly $80 billion and increase the Federal deficit by more than $100 billion during fiscal years 1992 through 1997.

A 1 percent lower annual real GDP growth rate during each of the fiscal years from 1992 to 1997 would decrease the Government's receipts by more than $260 billion and increase the deficit by nearly $350 billion during that period. The productive power of economic growth as contributor to Government revenues is not controversial.

If the collapse of communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union this past year have taught us anything at all, it is that Government policies that concentrate on managing how limited resources are distributed among the populace are a poor substitute for concentrating on ensuring economic growth.

If the collapse of communism ... this past year have taught us anything at all, it is that Government policies that concentrate on managing how limited resources are distributed among the populace are a poor substitute for concentrating on ensuring economic growth.

The President's Economic Growth Agenda

The President's economic growth agenda will accelerate economic recovery and job-creating investments, create opportunities for home ownership, foster a real estate recovery, and help families build for the future. The growth agenda set forth by the President is about jobs.

The plan calls for a new investment tax allowance, which would produce nearly $11 billion of tax savings in calendar 1992 for businesses that acquire new equipment, thereby increasing cash flow and lowering cost of capital.

The President also recommends permanent adjustments to simplify and liberalize the alternative minimum tax to remove tax impediments for modernizing business plans and equipment.

Jobs and global competitiveness also demand that businesses carry vigorous research and development. The President's plan would make permanent the credit for research and development and extend the rules for allocating R&D expenses to foreign and domestic income.

Although, as the largest economy in the world, the United States continues to be the largest investor in R&D activities, the rate of growth of nondefense R&D has recently been much higher in West Germany and Japan, as Graph TI-C demonstrates (See page 16).

The President has increased funding for basic research by 29 percent since 1989 and continues to recommend record levels of Federal funding for R&D. Each year since taking office, the President has proposed making the R&D tax credit permanent. This is the year for Congress to act.

14

TREASURY ISSUES

The President also urges Congress to cut the capital gains tax rate, which will raise American living standards by unlocking job-creating investments, boosting productivity, and raising the value of productive assets. The President has proposed cutting the capital gains tax to 15.4 percent for taxpayers now subject to a 28 percent capital gains tax rate and to 8.25 percent for taxpayers now subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax rate.

Reducing the capital gains tax will be particularly helpful to new companies and small businesses in attracting start-up capital. Small businesses and start-up companies traditionally rely on equity capital—they cannot float bonds, issue commercial paper or compete with big corporate rivals for bank loans. These firms continue to be the source of new jobs; businesses with 20 or fewer employees generate more than two-thirds of new private-sector jobs.

Lowering the capital gains tax to create jobs and make America more productive is a bipartisan objective. At least 220 Democratic Members of Congress--more than two thirds --have sponsored or cosponsored legislation to reduce the capital gains tax. The argument really is about what kind of capital gains tax to have. The President's proposal is broad. It would reduce the burden of overtaxation of inflationary gains for all. It would benefit the large number of middle-income people who realize capital gains and would unlock capital for more productive uses. A targeted capital gains tax cut could not serve each of these important purposes.

The President's economic growth plan also recognizes the importance of a healthy real estate sector in our economy and the critical need to ensure that businesses have access to credit. Real estate and construction represent more than 15 percent of our GDP, and employ almost 10 million people. More than half of all household net worth is in real estate.

That is why--in addition to our ongoing efforts to keep interest rates down and increase credit availability--the President has asked for a $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, modification of passive loss rules for real estate developers, opportunities for greater pension fund investments in real estate, deductibility of losses on the sale of personal residence, and an extension of mortgage revenue bond authority.

The President also proposes tax incentives for enterprise zones to stimulate jobs and investment in disadvantaged rule and urban areas, and an extension of both the targeted jobs tax credit and the low-income housing tax credit. President Bush's plan will both hasten economic recovery and help American families--with proposals that

These initiatives ... will make it possible for American families to buy homes, save for college, guard against major health expenses, and plan for retirement.

address their most pressing concerns. These include an increase in the personal exemption for families with children, and a new flexible Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that will allow families to begin saving, regardless of purpose, without income-tax burden.

In combination with the other proposals I have mentioned, the President's $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers will help middle-income families purchase their own homes and offer protection to current homeowners from declining property values.

In combination with the President's proposal to increase funding for Head Start by $600 million and the Administration's other education initiatives, the proposals to permit deduction of interest on qualifying student loans and penalty-free IRA withdrawals will help families fulfill their education goals.

The President's comprehensive health plan builds on the strength of the market-based system. It will provide tax credits or deductions for the purchase of health insurance of up to $3,750 for poor and middle-class families. This will provide financial help for more than 90 million people.

These initiatives will provide stimulus in both the short and long term. They will make it possible for American families to buy homes, save for college, guard against major health expenses, and plan for retirement. The President's plan is directed at the specific needs and aspirations of most Americans. For families attempting to buy a home, save for the future, finance educational loans, or purchase health insurance, the plan provides substantial tax savings.

Fairness

Issues of American justice arise in many contexts. But there can be no doubt that among them is the requirement that the burdens and benefits of Government must be fairly distributed. The President's plan meets this test of fairness. The current distribution of taxes and transfers is essentially

fair, despite widespread claims to the contrary. As Graph T1-D (See page 16) demonstrates, the net effect of Federal tax and transfer programs is highly progressive. In 1990, households in the top 20 percent paid an average of over $22,000 to the Federal Government, households in the lowest 20 percent received an average of almost $8,800 from the Federal Government.

But I do not wish to dwell on statistics. Statistics can be used to show almost anything. For example, tax distribution tables depict only the burden of payroll taxes and leave out entirely the payment of Social Security and Federal health insurance benefits.

These social insurance programs are highly progressive, and comparisons of the tax burden alone, without the benefits, present a very misleading picture. The Federal income tax is also progressive.

The President's plan for economic growth is fair. The full array of the President's tax proposals, including the President's health plan, would dramatically decrease taxes for low- and middle-income families and would only slightly reduce taxes for those with higher incomes.

The Need for Fiscal Restraint

The President's program to accelerate the economy, provide jobs, and improve the climate for long-term growth is accomplished while maintaining the fiscal restraint of pay-as-you-go.

We cannot achieve economic growth if Federal spending is not controlled. Confident, stable financial markets live in the house of financial discipline, and interest rates and long-term growth depend on this principle.

There is No Silver Bullet

Creating an environment through this nation's tax, spending and regulatory policies that invites and sustains long-term economic growth is no simple task. There is no silver bullet. However, we now have an opportunity to put some important building blocks in place. Together, we must begin that task today.

The President, in his State of the Union address, requested congressional action by March 20 on seven proposals:

The capital gains tax reduction.

The investment tax allowance.

The AMT enhancement and simplification.

The easing of passive loss restrictions on real estate developers.

The $5,000 credit for first-time homebuyers

The waiver of penalties on IRA withdrawals by first-time home buyers.

The proposals to facilitate real estate investment by pension funds and others.

These proposals should be enacted immediately to accelerate recovery. The total cost of these proposals over the period fiscal 1992 through 1997 is just over $4.5 billion.

The President's budget provides a variety of ways to cover this cost in a manner consistent with pay-as-you-go discipline. The President would prefer prompt enactment of all of his program. But surely these few changes can be enacted now.

It should be done promptly. And it must be paid for

Conclusion

Today, this nation remains the world's preeminent economic force. The United States is the world's largest exporter of goods and services and the world's largest foreign investor.

No one should underestimate the energy and optimism of the American people, nor the resilience and fundamental strengths of the American economy.

The Government alone cannot make American products more competitive, but, in partnership, the President, Congress, American businesses, and workers can construct an environment to facilitate the nation's productive growth.

Findings of the Joint Report on the Government Securities Market Revealed by Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance

After the admission of wrongdoing by Salomon Brothers, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission undertook a review of the Government Securities Market. The findings of that review were recently revealed and on February 3, 1992, the Department of Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance Jerome H. Powell spoke about those findings to the House Subcommittee on Oversight and to the Committee on Ways and Means. The following is from his statement.

Last fall, prompted by Salomon Brothers' revelations of wrongdoing, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) undertook a comprehensive review of the Government securities market, with a commitment to report back to Congress with our recommendations and conclusions.

After an intensive study conducted over the past several months, the three agencies released on January 22, the Joint Report on the Government Securities Market.

I would like to emphasize that the three agencies agree that the Government securities market is not flawed or broken in any fundamental economic sense.

However, there are several specific areas where the workings of the market could usefully be improved. These include mechanisms resulting in better enforcement of Treasury auction rules and in preventing and alleviating "short squeezes."

While the agencies were not able to reach a consensus on every point, there is substantial agreement among the agencies and that we share common objectives.

Among these objectives are preserving and enhancing the efficiency of the Government's financial mechanism, ensuring the integrity and fairness of the marketplace, deterring and detecting fraud, and protecting investors.

In particular, the agencies agree that, while change is necessary, it must be managed with care to ensure that the public debt is financed at the lowest possible cost.

In general, market-oriented solutions have been put forward whenever possible to support the effectiveness and efficiency of this very important market.

The agencies believe that the administrative and regulatory changes announced in the report, in combination with the report's legislative recommendations, will significantly improve the workings of the Government securities market. The improvements will ultimately rebound to the benefit of the U.S. taxpayer in the form of lower interest

The improvements will ultimately rebound to the benefit of the U.S. taxpayer in the form of lower interest costs on the public debt.

costs on the public debt. Changes already made in auction rules have had an impact--modestly broadening participation in the auctions--since their announcement on October 25.

As a result of the announcement that all Government securities brokers and dealers could submit bids for customers, 39 additional entities have been authorized by Treasury to do so. Previously, only primary dealers and depository institutions could submit bids for customers.

Eight broker/dealers have set up autocharge agreements to take advantage of broadened authority to submit bids without deposit.

And, finally, the increase in the noncompetitive limit for notes and bonds has resulted in dramatically larger noncompetitive awards for certain securities. For example, noncompetitive awards at the November 30-year bond auction, at $937 million, were over four times larger than the noncompetitive awards at the bond auction immediately prior to the increase in the award limit.

Administrative and Regulatory Changes

In order to combat short squeezes, the Treasury will provide additional quantities of security to the marketplace when an acute, protracted shortage develops, regardless of the reason for the shortage. The reopening of issues will greatly reduce the potential for short squeezes. Reopenings could occur either through standard auctions, through "tap" issues whereby the Treasury offers securities to the market on a continuous basis, or through other means.

19

TREASURY ISSUES

recognizes that this policy could prove difficult to implement but has concluded that it is justified under certain circumstances given the increased concerns about the potential for prolonged shortages. The other agencies concur in the judgment.

The Treasury also plans to improve the auction process. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have accelerated the schedule for automating Treasury auctions.

It is anticipated that the auctions will be automated by the end of 1992. Automation will allow for the use of different auction techniques and for better monitoring of compliance with Treasury auction rules. The Treasury will consider implementing an open method of auctioning securities with repeated rounds of bidding at descending yields. The total bids received at each yield would be announced after each round. All securities would be awarded at a single yield.

Such a system will be feasible once the auctions are automated and could encourage broader participation in Treasury auctions and discourage attempts to engage in manipulative strategies.

To clarify auction rules, Treasury prepared a uniform offering circular, published in the Federal Register on January 31, as a proposed rule with a request for comments. A new working group comprising the Treasury, the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been formed to improve surveillance and to strengthen interagency coordination.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will enhance and expand its market surveillance efforts, in its role as the agency that collects and provides the agencies with information needed for surveillance purposes.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has announced changes to the primary dealer system, which will make the system open to more firms, but will not eliminate primary dealers. The changes will also serve to clarify that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is not the regulator of the primary dealers.

Primary dealers will continue to be required to participate in a meaningful way in Treasury auctions and to be responsive to the needs of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Open Market Desk. Treasury believes the changes to the primary dealer system represent a balanced approach that recognizes an evolving marketplace and the success of the

regulatory structure provided by the Government Securities Act of 1986 (GSA).

Legislative Recommendations

The agencies all support prompt reauthorization of the Treasury's rule making authority under the GSA, which expired on October 1, 1991. We hope that the House of Representatives will act soon on this matter.

The agencies also support the provision in S.1699, which the Senate passed September 25, that would make it an explicit violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to make false or misleading written statements in connection with the issuance of Government securities. With respect to the securities of Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the agencies support removing the exemptions from the Federal securities laws for equity and unsecured debt.

Since this recommendation may receive considerable attention, it should be emphasized that this proposal would not affect GSE mortgaged-backed securities. This proposal is limited in other ways as well. In particular, any legislation enacting this recommendation should make clear that all GSE securities would maintain their current eligibility for use in repurchase agreement transactions and for trading by Government brokers and dealers that have registered or filed notice under section 15C of the Exchange Act.

The Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the SEC support legislation that would give the Treasury backup authority to require reports from holders of large positions in particular Treasury securities. This authority would not be used unless the reopening policy and other measures fail to solve the problem of acute, protracted market shortages.

The report represents a serious effort by the agencies to arrive at a consensus on measures that can be taken to improve the Government securities market. To a large extent, we were able to reach a consensus. On those matters requiring legislative action by the Congress, we hope that such action can be taken promptly.

In closing, I would like to mention that we are especially appreciative of the continued interest of this Subcommittee and the full committee in assuring the Treasury can continue to finance the public debt at the lowest possible cost.

Recent Reports and Studies
Economic Developments and Reforms in the Former Soviet Union

On February 5, 1992, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, spoke to the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, and the Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade, and Monetary Policy regarding economic reform measures in the former Soviet Union.

According to the Under Secretary, the GDP for the former Soviet Union fell by as much as 12 percent in 1991, and the IMF estimated inflation of 140 percent for the same year. The budget deficit increased to more than 22 percent of GDP. However, a trade surplus was the result of declines in both imports and exports. In January of this year, the Russian government introduced a 28 percent value added tax, a 32 percent profits tax, and a 37 percent wage tax. Overall, consumer prices have roughly doubled since January.

The Russian Federation is working in cooperation with the IMF to pursue economic reform. Plans include changes in fiscal and monetary policies, the foreign exchange system, price liberalization, and privatization. Russia has cut both domestic and military spending substantially. Several other

former republics are also working with the IMF and other international institutions. Secretary of State James Brady announced U.S. support for early consideration of IMF and World Bank membership for new states establishing diplomatic relations with the United States.

The exchange rate for commercial transactions is 110 rubles to the dollar. Russian authorities expect the value of the ruble to strengthen as confidence in the reform program increases. However, a proposal by the Central Bank for a "foreign investment" rate of 8-10 rubles to the dollar could have a substantial negative impact on foreign investment.

The Western response to the reforms taking place includes debt deferral by leading creditor countries, humanitarian and food aid, technical assistance, and nuclear risk reduction. Contrasting the current situation with the rebuilding of Europe following World War II, the Under-Secretary said "the process in the new states requires creation of institutions and systems for a market-based economy, which has not existed in these countries during much of the present century."

Changing Economic and Financial Relationships Between the United States and Pacific Region

Treasury's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Developing Nations spoke to the Bankers' Association for Foreign Trade on January 23 about relationships between the United States and Taiwan and Korea. According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary, the nature of those relationships has changed as Asian economies have grown and prospered.

The first objective in consultations with Korea and Taiwan is to improve treatment of U.S. financial firms, ensuring them equality of competitive opportunity with domestic counterparts. The United States is also seeking broader liberalization of financial markets to include interest deregulation, elimination of capital controls, and changes to exchange rate policies.

In both Korea and Taiwan, policies exist that discriminate against foreign institutions. Taiwan strictly limits foreign banks' access to domestic funding resources and restricts foreign exchange activities. Korea offers a "closed, protected, unfair, and discriminatory environment for foreign institutions," and strictly controls and directs foreign exchange activities. Banks must adhere to a long list of prohibited activities. A regulatory system is used in Korea with minimal written implementation.

The Deputy Assistant Secretary concluded that the newly industrializing economies must "take up the challenge of liberalization and opening markets" if more equitable financial markets are to be established.

Deputy Secretary Robson Addresses the Mortgage Bankers Association

February 3, 1992, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury John E. Robson addressed the Mortgage Bankers' Association to discuss the Administration's proposals for bank reforms aimed in part at strengthening the real estate industry. He described the economy as "unsatisfactorily sluggish" due to "forces in the business cycle." He referred to the President's economic growth plan that includes passive loss relief, using pension funds for real estate investment, extending tax credits to stimulate construction and refurbish low income rental housing, and cutting the capital gains tax. The plan also incorporates a $5,000 credit and penalty free withdrawal from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) for first time buyers, and other tax incentives. The plan is intended to result in increased real estate values and a stronger market.

Concerning the present "credit crunch," the Deputy Secretary remarked that too little credit has been available to fuel the real estate industry. He called on banks to "come out of hibernation and start lending." "Banking," he said, "is not a risk free and not intended to be so. And bankers should be stepping forward now to make loans to sound borrowers." Credit crunch guidelines were created by the four bank regulatory agencies to ensure "balance and good judgment" in bank and thrift examinations. They instruct examiners to view real estate values in the long term.

"We cannot have examiners hanging a scarlet letter on real estate," Deputy Secretary Robson said. The Administration supports changes in regulatory law, including flexibility

TREASURY ISSUES

for the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in granting extensions to thrifts that must set aside capital against real estate investments, as well as a reduction in the amount of capital that must be set aside. Deputy Secretary Robson blamed the weak banking system on antiquated laws that prevent financial health and reduce international competitiveness.

argument for fundamental bank reform, he said that rather than adopting the Administration's bank reforms Congress has passed "flawed legislation that imposes more regulation, higher costs, and offers no opportunity for the banks to strengthen themselves financially."

The Administration's Views on Thrift Institutions' Deductions of Reimbursed Losses

On February 11, 1992, Terrill A. Hyde, Deputy Tax Legislative Counsel for Regulatory Affairs, presented to the House Committee on Ways and Means the Administration's views on the extent to which thrift institutions should be permitted to deduct losses that are reimbursed with tax free Government assistance.

Under capital loss protection provisions, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) agreed to protect resolved institutions against losses realized on the sale of or write down on designated assets. Institutions were generally reimbursed for the difference between the book value of an asset and the selling price or the write down value. Under guaranteed yield maintenance, institutions were guaranteed a minimum yield or return on covered assets. Assistance agreement made in 1988 and 1989 obligated the FSLIC to make ongoing assistance payments to 91 remain-

ing institutions resolved in 1988 and 1989 transactions. Those institutions take the position that the Government assistance is deductible for income tax purposes. Treasury's "Report on Tax Issues Relating to the 1988/89 Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Assisted Transactions" concludes that reimbursed losses should not be deductible and that the issue is governed by principles of tax law precluding deduction of compensation by insurance.

The report recommends legislation to clarify deductibility to avoid the delay and cost of litigation on this issue by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The report determines that the potential cost to the taxpayer of continuing the incentives to hold covered assets and to minimize the value of assets when sold would outweigh the cost of "creating the perception that the Government is not adhering to its bargain."

Report to Congress on the Request for Additional Funding for the Resolution Trust Corporation

On September 12, 1991, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury John E. Robson spoke to the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation and Insurance to support the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) Oversight Board's request for additional funding for RTC, RTC asset disposition and RTC restructuring. (The bill has since been passed to the full committee.)

The Oversight Board requested additional funds to cover losses as well as working capital to finance RTC's acquisition of failed thrifts. The Board estimated that another $80 billion in loss funds would be needed, doubling the amount already authorized. It also requested that the RTC's borrowing limit be raised from $125 billion to $160 billion. Also, RTC is requesting an extension of Office of Thrift Supervision transfer authority until September 30, 1993, citing a larger than expected case load. Deputy Secretary Robson said

RTC is "making progress" in meeting clean-up goals, and that mandated improvements in RTC management include a uniform Conservatorship Operations Manual, a soon-to-be-operational computerized securities portfolio management system, an assets tracking system, and standardized contracting policies and procedures. As of June 30, RTC had sold 51 percent of seized assets, netting $168.2 billion. Also, 73 percent of RTC's book value of securities has been sold with only a 3 percent loss. Through August of 1991, RTC has sold $2.5 billion of its mortgage-backed securities and is considering how to secure commercial loans.

The RTC has introduced a portfolio sales program to increase asset sales due to growing inventories of hard-to-sell assets and is promoting the sale of single and multi-family homes. As of June 30,1991, 22 percent of its single-family homes;10 percent of the multi-family homes had been sold.

Report to Congress on Tax Simplification, Employee Benefits; Proposals Concerning Tax Deposits, Earned Income Tax Credit, and Pension Coverage and Portability

September 10, 1991, Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, addressed the Senate Subcommittee on Taxation and the Committee on Finance on tax simplification proposals pending (S. 1394 and S. 1364) and related proposals. The Tax Simplification Act of 1991 (S. 1394) is estimated by the Office of Tax Analysis to be "nearly revenue neutral, with a loss of $89 million in fiscal 1992 and $47 million over the 5-year budget period."

Employee Benefits Simplification and Expansion Act of 1991 (S. 1364), according to the Administration, would lose approximately $16 billion in its current form. Although the Administration believes that simplification of benefit provisions "can be achieved within the parameters of the budget agreement," it opposes legislation that loses revenue. Proposed simplification of the employment tax deposit system (H.R. 2775) would require semi-weekly deposits instead of the

22

TREASURY ISSUES

eight monthly deposits required by the current system. Also proposed: repeals of "interaction rules" preventing taxpayers from receiving full benefit of health insurance credit, the young child credit, and other provisions.

Also under consideration is the simplification of tax laws to expand pension coverage and enhance pension por-

tability. The Administration's proposals include simplifying and encouraging tax free rollovers, establishing a simplified employee pension program, simplifying the administration of 401(k) and other plans, extending 401(k) plans to Government employees and employees of tax-exempt organizations, and adopting a uniform vesting standard.

The Administration's Views on a Proposal To Allow U.S.-Controlled Foreign Corporations To Elect To Be Taxed as Domestic Corporations

On October 3, 1991, Philip D. Morrison, International Tax Counsel, Department of the Treasury, presented to the House Committee on Ways and Means the Administration's views on H.R. 2889 and on the proposed taxing of U.S.-controlled foreign corporations. The Administration opposes H.R. 2889, which would eliminate deferral on income from property imported into the United States, including profits, commissions, and fees. The Administration's opposition stems from the difficulty in enforcement, the fact that the proposal differs significantly from the traditional focus, and the lack of impact, due in part to excess foreign tax credits.

Under the bill, the IRS would be required to trace indirect sales, as well as determine whether a U.S.-controlled corporation should have "...expected at the time of the initial sale that the property would ultimately be imported into the United States." Adding to the complexity of these tasks is the fact that the bill also applies to components incorporated into

other products, which are subsequently imported.

Further complicating enforcement would be the importation of components used in U.S manufacturing of products to be exported.

Another concern is that the bill would increase taxes for U.S.-controlled agricultural or mineral companies that, due to geographical limitations, must operate abroad. The Administration also expresses reservations concerning the impact of the bill for companies who import from both high-tax and low-tax countries. The Administration also opposes U.S. shareholders being allowed to treat U.S.-controlled foreign corporations as U.S. corporations. It is the Administration's view that a reduction in tax liabilities would result in approximately $1.5 billion in revenue losses over the 5-year budget window, unless safeguards are provided.

Integration of the Corporate and Individual Tax Systems

On January 6, 1992, Treasury released a report on integration of the tax system. The current tax system taxes corporate profits distributed to shareholders at least twice—once at the corporate level and once at the shareholder level. The "Report of the Department of the Treasury on Integration of the Individual and Corporate Tax Systems: Taxing Business Income Once" documents the distortions created by the double tax and describes several integration prototypes for

taxing corporate income once. The Report does not contain any legislative recommendations, but rather is intended to stimulate discussion of the prototypes and encourage serious consideration of proposals for integrating the individual and corporate tax systems in the United States. The report is available from the Government Printing Office, GPO Stock Number 048-000-00430-0, price $14.00.

Tax Treatment of Deferred Compensation Under Section 457

The "Report to the Congress on the Tax Treatment of Deferred Compensation Under Section 457" was released on January 7, 1992. Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of deferred compensation provided to employees of tax-exempt organizations and State or local governments. The report summarizes the legislative history and the underlying policies of section 457, regarding tax-exempt organizations. The report concludes that statutory limits are appropriate because, unlike taxable employers, employers that are exempt from income taxation have no

tax-incentive to limit deferred compensation. Moreover, section 457 serves as an incentive for tax-exempt employers to provide greater benefits through tax-qualified plans. The report finds, however, that current law does not allow certain tax-exempt employers to offer salary reduction plans to their employees and recommends that section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangements be extended to nongovernmental, tax-exempt employers.

Allocation of Excess Pension Plan Assets in the Case of Bridge Banks

In response to the requirements of Section 6067(b) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Treasury released its "Study on the Allocation of Excess Pension Plan Assets in the Case of Bridge Banks" January 7, 1992. The study examines the conflicting goals of pension policy and bank insurance policy in an over funded defined benefit pension plan sponsored by a bank holding company for the joint

benefit of the employees of the bank holding company and a failing subsidiary bank. The study concludes that the current provision in the Internal Revenue Code should be amended to require an equitable allocation of the full amount of the excess pension assets whenever a bridge bank receives assets and liabilities of an insured bank closed by regulations.

Report to the Congress on the Tax Treatment of Bad Debts by Financial Institutions

Treasury's "Report to the Congress on the Tax Treatment of Bad Debts by Financial Institutions" was released on September 16, 1991. The report studies the criteria to be used in determining whether a debt is worthless for Federal tax purposes and specifically considers circumstances under which a conclusive or rebuttable presumption of worthlessness is appropriate. The report notes that recently proposed regulations generally allow banks and thrifts to conform their

tax and regulatory accounting for the charge-off of bad debts, but concludes that conformity of tax and regulatory treatment should not apply to accrued but unpaid interest on loans that are placed in nonaccrual status for regulatory purposes. The report further concludes that extension of the conformity rules to unregulated lenders would be a significant departure from settled policy and practice that should be left to Congress to consider.

Report on Tax Issues Relating to the 1988/89 FSLIC Assisted Transactions

On March 5, 1991, Treasury released its "Report on Tax Issues Relating to the 1988/89 Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Assisted Transactions." (For the complete text of the report, see page 3 of the Spring, 1991 issue.) The report analyzes and provides Treasury's views on the tax issues raised by the RTC's "Report to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Con-

gess on the 1988/89 Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Assistance Agreements." Comments on the report, prepared by the Office of Tax Policy, may be addressed to Gregory J.

Report on Social Security and the Public Debt

James E. Duggan's Research Paper No. 9102 stresses the public debt implications of the long-run financial status of the social security program. For the next 25 years, the program is expected to have average surpluses of .6 percent of Gross National Product (GNP). After that, the senior economist says, deficits will reach 1.7 percent of GNP (4 percent after the addition of health care). These deficits

could result in large, unstable debt ratios and may affect future U.S. debt policy. The paper presents three alternatives, or combinations thereof, for financing Social Security obligations. James E. Duggan is a senior economist, Office of Economic Policy, U.S. Department of the Treasury.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usually takes the form of appropriations that allow obligations to be incurred and payments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have expired or would otherwise expire. These are counted as new budget authority in the fiscal year of the legislation in which the reappropriation act is included, regardless of when the amounts were originally appropriated or when they would otherwise lapse.

Obligations generally are liquidated by the issuance of checks for the disbursement of cash-outlays. Obligations may also be liquidated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned-income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipt accounts). Collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts normally can be used without appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements to appropriations, and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust); collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into two categories: (1) proprietary receipts, which are collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function, and (2) intra-governmental funds, which are payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts. They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions–payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions–payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions–payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and outlays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments

(including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1961. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government's fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them outside of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal old-age and survivors insurance, and Federal disability insurance.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit ordinarily are not subject to targets set by the congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused on both on-and off-budget receipts, outlays, and deficit of the Government.

Tables FFO-1, FFO-2, and FFO-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, estimates for 2 years, detail for 13 months, and fiscal year-to-date data. They provide a summary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal entities and disbursing officers, and daily reports from the Federal Reserve banks. They detail accounting transactions affecting receipts and outlays of the Government and off-budget Federal entities and their related effect on assets and liabilities of the Government. Data are derived from the Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets, and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FFO-2 includes on- and off-budget receipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FF0-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FFO-4 (Fall issue) summarizes internal revenue collections by States and other areas and by type of tax. Amounts reported are collections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (i.e., estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), of payments made with tax returns, and of subsequent payments made after tax returns are due or are filed (i.e., payments with delinquent returns or on delinquent accounts).

It is important to note that these data do not necessarily reflect the Federal tax burden of individual States. Amounts are reported based on the primary filing address provided by each taxpayer or reporting entity. For multistate corporations, the address may reflect only the State where such a corporation reported its taxes from a principal office rather than other States where income was earned or where individual income and Social Security taxes were withheld. In addition, an individual may reside in one State and work in another.

FEDERAL FISCAL OPERATIONS

Budget Results for the First Quarter, Fiscal 1992

Summary

The Federal deficit narrowed in the first 3 months of fiscal 1992 to $83.2 billion from $86.2 billion in the corresponding months of the prior fiscal year. That improvement was due solely to a $19 billion swing in Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) and other deposit insurance outlays. Excluding deposit insurance spending, the deficit widened by $16 billion between the 2 periods.

The swing in deposit insurance outlays partly resulted from delays in enactment of funding for the RTC and partly from increased asset sales and stepped up repayments of advances previously made to troubled institutions. Deposit insurance outlays had exceeded $14 billion in the initial quarter of fiscal 1991, but were negative by close to $5 billion in the first quarter of the current fiscal year when asset sales (counted as negative spending in the budget accounts) outpaced gross spending.

The fall off in deposit insurance spending held the year-over-year increase in total budget outlays in the first quarter of fiscal 1992 to a narrow 0.7 percent. Excluding deposit insurance and foreign contributions to the Desert Shield/Storm operations, outlays were up by close to 6-1/2 percent. That was only a little behind the 7-2/3 percent pace projected on the same basis for the entire fiscal year in the Administration's budget projections released at the end of January.

Major spending increases were concentrated in the area of income support, reflecting generally soft economic conditions and also an upward trend recently in participation in "social safety net" programs. Within the income security function of the budget accounts, unemployment insurance benefits jumped by 35 percent and food stamp outlays rose by 21 percent. These same forces, with rising medical care prices, pushed up health care costs. In the health function, Medicaid grants to States were up by 42 percent. Medicare spending increased by 20 percent.

Among other outlay categories, net interest costs rose by 7 percent, as an increase of more than 11 percent in the outstanding debt held by the public was partly offset by lower interest rates. Defense spending, exclusive of Desert Shield/Storm contributions, fell by 4-1/4 percent.

Total receipts increased by 2.2 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 1992 from a year earlier, which was in line with the 2.0 percent that has been projected by the Administration for the entire fiscal year. Withheld income and employment taxes rose by 2.5 percent, or just a shade faster than the 2.1 percent increase in the underlying wage and salary tax base. Corporate income taxes declined by 4 percent, reflecting a decline from a year earlier in the December quarterly tax payment and some increase in refunds (counted as negative tax receipts).

FEDERAL FISCAL OPERATIONS

Fourth-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1991 supplements fiscal data earlier reported in the summer issue of the Treasury Bulletin. At the time of that issue's release, not enough data was available to analyze adequately collections for the quarter.

Individual income taxes.-Individual income tax receipts were $121.0 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1991. This represents an increase of $4.6 billion over the comparable quarter for FY 1990. Withheld receipts were up $3.2 billion for this period. Of this increase, $2.6 billion represents the normal quarterly reconciliation between the general fund and the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Nonwithheld receipts increased $1.6 billion over the comparable quarter of FY 1990, while refunds increased by $0.2 billion.

Corporate income taxes.--Net corporate receipts for the fourth quarter of FY 1991 were $21.7 billion. This was $0.6 billion higher than the fourth quarter of FY 1990. The $0.6 billion increase was attributable to an increase in backtaxes of $1.1 billion that was partially offset by a decrease in estimated and final payments of $0.5 billion.

Employment taxes and contributions--Employment taxes and contributions receipts for the July-September 1991 quarter were $89.5 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the old-age and survivors insurance, the disability insurance, and the hospital insurance trust funds increased by $1.7 billion, $0.1 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively. The increase from the prior year is due to a $0.6 billion decrease in accounting adjustments for previous years and a $4.2 billion increase in estimated liability for the July-September quarter.

Unemployment Insurance.--Unemployment insurance receipts for the July-September quarter were $5.2 billion compared with $5.6 billion for the comparable prior year quarter. Both Federal Unemployment Tax Act receipts and State deposits decreased by $0.2 billion.

Contributions for other insurance and retirement.- Contributions for other retirement were $1.2 billion for the

fourth quarter of fiscal 1991. This represents no change from the fourth quarter of fiscal 1990. The growth in contributions will remain flat over the next few years as the number of employees covered by the Federal employees' retirement system (FERS) grows slowly relative to those covered under the civil service retirement system (CSRS).

Excise tax.--Excise tax receipts for the July-September 1991 quarter were $12.9 billion compared to $8.6 billion for the comparable quarter of FY 1990. The increase of $4.3 billion (51%) over the prior year level is the result of the increased excise tax rates and broadened tax base enacted as a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and changes in the timing of collections.

Estate and gift taxes.--Estate and gift tax receipts were $2.9 billion in the July-September quarter of 1991. This represents a decrease of $0.2 billion over the previous quarter and an increase of $0.2 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts for the FY 1991 were $11.1 billion, down from $11.5 billion in the previous year. This decline can be attributed to a reduction in gift tax collections.

Customs duties.—Customs receipts net of refunds were $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter of FY 1991. This is a decrease of $0.1 billion from the comparable prior year quarter. It is due to a decrease in imports.

Miscellaneous receipts.--Net miscellaneous receipts for the fourth quarter of FY 1991 were $5.4 billion, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the comparable prior year quarter. Deposits of Federal Reserve earnings decreased by $2.7 billion in part due to a decrease in the value of assets denominated in foreign currency. Other miscellaneous receipts increased by $0.2 billion.

1 State receipts do not indicate the Federal tax burden of each since, in many instances, taxes are collected in one State from residents of another State. For example, withholding taxes reported by employers located near State lines may include substantial amounts withheld from salaries of employees who reside in neighboring States. Also, the taxes of some corporations are paid from a principal office, although their operations may be located in another State, or throughout several States.
2 Collections of individual income tax (withheld and not withheld) include old-age, survivor's, disability, and hospital insurance taxes on salaries and wages (FICA) and self-employment income (SECA).
3 Individual income tax rates for tax year 1990 were 15, 28, and 33 percent of taxable income. Includes SECA taxes imposed on taxable self-employment income. Includes fiduciary income tax collections of $4.8 billion.
5 Income tax rates for 1990 were 15, 28, and 33 percent. A combined FICA rate of 15.3 percent was imposed on taxable wages up to $50,400.
6 Railroad retirement tax is divided into two tiers. Tier I tax rate was 7.65 percent for both employers and employees on the first $51,300 of annual compensation. Tier II tax rate was 16.1 percent for employers and 4.9 percent for employees on the first $38,100.
7 A tax rate of 6.2 percent was imposed on employers with one or more covered employees in each of 20 days in a year, each day being in a different week, or with a quarterly payroll for covered employment of at least $1,500 in the current or preceding calendar year. This was applied to the first $7,000 of taxable wages paid to each covered employee. The tax is

reduced by credits of up to 5.4 percent for unemployment contributions paid to State. 8 Corporate tax rates generally ranged from 15 to 39 percent of taxable income. 9 Includes taxes of $155.6 million on unrelated business income of exempt organizations (Forms 990T). 10 Estate and gift tax rates ranged from 18 to 55 percent. 11 Represents IRS transfer of the Presidential Election Campaign check-off option on income tax return tax returns processed during the fiscal year ended 9-30-91 of $1 per single return and $1 or $2 per joint return from the Individual Income Withholding Receipt Account Number 20-0101 to account number 20-5081. A total of $32.3 million was designated on 22.3 million returns. 12 Amounts not classified by State or district as of the end of the fiscal year. This includes tax payments made to banks under the Federal Tax Deposit (FTD) System. These payments are included in collections but are not classified by district until applied to taxpayer accounts. Also included are credits allowable on income tax returns for certain gasoline, diesel, and special motor fuel tax payments and for excess payments under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act. Note.--Detail may not add to totals due to rounding. Amounts reflect adjustments made to data reported in prior years. Negative figures are displayed when prior year adjustments exceed current year receipts.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Obligations

The Federal Government controls the use of funds through "obligations." Obligations are recorded when the Government makes a commitment to acquire goods or services. Obligations are the first of four key events that characterize the acquisition and use of resources: order, payment, delivery, and consumption. In general, they consist of orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions requiring the disbursement of money.

The obligational stage of a Government transaction is a strategic point in gauging the impact of the Government's operations on the national economy because it frequently represents a Government commitment that stimulates business investments, such as inventory purchases and employment.

months after the Government places its order, the order itself can cause immediate pressure on the private economy.

An obligation is classified by the nature of the transaction without regard to its ultimate purpose. For example, all salaries and wages are reported as personnel compensation, whether the services are used in current operations or in the construction of capital items.

Federal agencies often do business with one another. In doing so, the "buying" agency records obligations and the "performing" agency records reimbursements. In Table FO-1, these transactions are presented. Conversely, Table FO-2 shows only those transactions incurred outside the Federal Government.

1 For Federal budget presentation a concept of "net obligations incurred" is generally used. This concept eliminates transactions within the Government and revenue and reimbursements from the public which by statute may be used by Government agencies without

appropriation action by the Congress. Summary figures on this basis follow. (Data are on the basis of Reports on Obligations presentation and therefore may differ somewhat from the Budget of the U.S. Government.)

CHART SLOFC-A. --Commitments and Contingencies

This report contains totals for commitments of the Government that represent the value of goods and services ordered and obligated but not yet received. It also included other commitments against appropriations, all pursuant to section 1311 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1955 (31 U.S.C. 200). Contingencies represent conditional commitments that may become liabilities due to events beyond the control of the Government. The amounts are agency projections stated in terms of maximum theoretical risk exposure. The data for commitments come from agency financial statements while contingency data are from unaudited agency reports, which have not been compared with any other Treasury reports.

Note: FMS expects to compile 1991 contingencies data by May 31, 1992. A copy of the detailed schedules can be obtained from the Financial Reports Branch (202) 208-1709.

Amounts presented in this report were compiled from public debt budget report information and reports submitted by the agencies in accordance with Vol. I, Part 2, Chapter 4100 of the Treasury Financial Manual (Transmittal Letter No. 512). The information furnished by some reporting agencies was based on estimates.

INTRODUCTION: Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The Treasury's operating cash is maintained in accounts with the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs) and branches, as well as in tax and loan accounts in other financial institutions. Major information sources include the Daily Balance Wire received from the FRBs and branches, and electronic transfers through the Letter of Credit Payment, Fedline Payment, and Fedwire Deposit Systems. As the FRB accounts are depleted, funds are called in (withdrawn) from thousands of tax and loan accounts at financial institutions throughout the country.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147, Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositories maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan investment program, depository financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate. Financial institutions wishing to retain funds deposited into their tax and loan accounts in interest-bearing obligations participate under the

Note Option. The program permits Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in Note Option depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way, the Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuating operations on Note Option financial institution reserves and on the economy. Likewise, those institutions wishing to remit the funds to the Treasury's account at FRBs do so under the Remittance Option.

Deposits to tax and loan accounts occur as customers of financial institutions deposit tax payments, which the financial institutions use to purchase Government securities. In most cases, this involves a transfer of funds from a customer's account to the tax and loan account in the same financial institution. Also, Treasury can direct the FRBs to invest excess funds in tax and loan accounts directly from the Treasury account at the FRBs.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities issued by other Federal agencies accounting for the rest. The tables in this section of the Treasury Bulletin reflect the total. Further detailed information is published in the Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States. Likewise, information on agency securities and on the investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.

Table FD-1 summarizes the Federal debt by listing public debt and agency securities held by the public, including the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agencies, largely by the Social Security and other Federal retirement trust funds. (For greater detail on holdings of Federal securities by particular classes of investors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type interest-bearing marketable and nonmarketable Treasury securities. The difference between interest-bearing and total public debt securities reflects outstanding matured Treasury securities—that is, unredeemed securities that have matured and are no longer accruing interest. Because the Federal Financing Bank is under the supervision of the Treasury, its securities are held by a U.S. Government account.

In Table FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by issues to particular funds within Government. Many of the funds invest in par-value special series nonmarketables at interest rates determined by law. Others invest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents interest-bearing securities issued by Government agencies. Federal agency borrowing has declined in recent years, in part because the Federal Financing Bank has provided financing to other Federal agencies. Meanwhile, Government-sponsored entities whose securities are presented in this table

are not Federal agencies, and their securities are not guaranteed by the Federal Government. (Federal agency borrowing from the Treasury is presented in the Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.)

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt. Average maturity has increased gradually since it hit a low of 2 years, 5 months, in December 1975. In March 1971, Congress enacted a limited exception to the 4-1/4-percent interest rate ceiling on Treasury bonds. This permitted Treasury to offer securities maturing in more than 7 years at current market rates of interest for the first time since 1965. This exception has expanded since 1971 authorizing Treasury to continue to issue long-term securities, and the ceiling on Treasury bonds was repealed on November 10, 1988. The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the Federal Reserve banks.

In Table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling. Changes in the non-interest-bearing debt shown in the last column reflect maturities of Treasury securities on nonbusiness days, which can be redeemed on the next business day.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Public Debt Operations

The Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 3101, et seq.) allows the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment, and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each marketable security is listed in the Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States. The information in this section of the Treasury Bulletin pertains only to marketable Treasury securities, current bills, notes, and bonds.

Table PDO-1 provides a maturity schedule of interest-bearing marketable public debt securities other than regular weekly and 52-week bills. All unmatured Treasury notes and bonds are listed in maturity order, from earliest to latest. A separate breakout is provided for the combined holdings of the Government accounts and Federal Reserve banks, so that the "all other investors" category includes all private holdings.

Table PDO-2 presents the results of weekly auctions of 13- and 26-week bills, as well as auctions of 52-week bills, which are held every fourth week. Treasury bills mature each Thursday. New issues of 13-week bills are reopenings of 26-week bills. The 26-week bill

issued every fourth week to mature on the same Thursday as an existing 52-week bill is a reopening of the existing 52-week bill. The new issues of cash management bills are also presented. The high, low, and average yields on accepted tenders and the dollar value of total bids are presented, with the dollar value of awards made on both competitive and noncompetitive basis.

Treasury accepts noncompetitive tenders of up to $1 million for bills and $5 million for notes and bonds in each auction of securities to encourage participation of individuals and smaller institutions.

Table PDO-3 lists the results of auctions of marketable securities, other than weekly bills, in chronological order over the past 2 years. Included are: notes and bonds from table PDO-1; 52-week bills from table PDO-2; and data for cash management bills. The maturities of cash management bills coincide with those of regular issues of Treasury bills.

Table PDO-4 indicates the total amount of marketable securities allotted to each class of investor. The Federal Reserve banks initially into investor classes the tenders in each auction of marketable securities other than weekly auctions of 13- and 26-week bills.

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, and notes that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. (See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.)

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and nonmarketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the Federal Reserve banks, and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The Federal Reserve banks acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated amount of public debt securities held by private investors. This information is obtained from sources such as the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies. State, local, and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and foreign official accounts. They also include municipal, foreign official, and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes for description of investor categories.)

INTRODUCTION: Market Yields

The tables and charts in this section present yields on Treasury marketable securities, and compare long-term yields on Treasury securities with yields on long-term corporate and municipal securities.

Table MY-1 lists Treasury market bid yields at constant maturities for bills, notes, and bonds. The Treasury yield curve, presented in the accompanying chart, is based on current market bid quotations on the most actively traded Treasury securities as of 3:30 p.m. on the last business day of the calendar quarter. Treasury obtains quotations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which composites quotations provided by five primary dealers. Treasury uses these composite quotations to derive the yield curve, based on semiannual interest payments and read at constant maturity points to develop a consistent data series. Yields on Treasury bills are the coupon equivalent yields of bank discount rates at which Treasury

bills trade in the market. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System publishes the Treasury constant maturity data series in its weekly H.15 press release.

Table MY-2 shows the average yields of long-term Treasury, corporate, and municipal bonds. The long-term Treasury average yield is the 30-year constant maturity yield. The corporate bond average yield is developed by the Treasury by calculating reoffering yields on new long-term securities maturing in at least 20 years and rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service. The municipal bond average yield prior to 1991 was compiled by the Treasury. Beginning with January 1991, the average yield is the "Municipal Bond Yield Average," published by Moody's Investors Service for 20-year reoffering yields on selected Aa-rated general obligations. See the footnotes to the table for further explanation.

INTRODUCTION: U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation

The U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation (USCC) statement informs the public of the total face value of currency and coin used as a medium of exchange that is in circulation at the end of a given accounting month. The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion that is deemed to be in circulation. Although it still includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate, or that may do so to a limited extent, Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various issues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census. USCC information has been published by the Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when the USCC was incorporated into the Treasury Bulletin. The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, various U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve banks, and the Federal Reserve Board.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Agencies' Financial Reports

Section 114 of the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 (31 U.S.C. 3513a) requires each executive agency to provide the Secretary of the Treasury with reports and information on the agency's financial condition and operations. Although these provisions do not apply to the Federal Government's legislative and judicial branches, they are encouraged to submit reports so that the Secretary of the Treasury can prepare comprehensive reports on all of the financial activities of the Government.

Federal agencies submit four financial reports and three supporting reports. The financial reports include: Report on Financial Position (SF 220), Report on Operations (SF 221), Report on Cash Flow (SF 222), and Report on Reconciliation (SF 223). The supporting reports are: Direct and Guaranteed Loans Reported by Agency and Program Due from the Public (SF 220-8), Report on Accounts and Loans Receivable Due from the Public (SF 220-9), and Additional Financial Information (SF 220-1). Agencies submit SF 220-8 quarterly, and annually for publication in the Treasury Bulletin. Meanwhile, all agencies submit SF 220-9 annually, while some report quarterly on a selected basis.

The Treasury Financial Manual (ITFM 2-4100) sets the criteria for the submission of annual and quarterly reports in accordance with the Reporting Entities Listing (Bulletin No. 91-09). There are reports for six fund types: revolving funds, trust revolving funds, 15 major trust funds, all other trust funds, all other activity combined, and

consolidated reports of each organizational unit. Financial transactions supporting the reports are accounted for on the accrual basis, although the SF 221 can be submitted on a cash basis under certain circumstances.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-127 requires agencies to prepare reports from a budgeting and accounting system that contains an integrated data base, which is part of the agency's integrated financial management system. Reports are supposed to include all assets, liabilities, and equities relating to all programs and activities under control of the reporting agency. (Treasury reports assets of disbursing officers.)

Reports should also include transfer appropriation accounts from other agencies, foreign currencies, operations conducted in the territories or overseas, and any monetary assets or property received, spent, or otherwise accounted for by the reporting agency. Amounts are reported to the dollar.

Information from SF 220-8 is presented in Table FA-1, which reflects the direct and guaranteed loans to the public through the Federal Credit Program to support credit activities. Credit program levels are controlled by authorizing legislation and appropriation acts. SF 220-8 also provides the Federal Reserve Board information to monitor the flow of funds. The accompanying chart depicts direct and guaranteed loans for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1991.

INTRODUCTION: International Financial Statistics

The tables in this section provide statistics on the U.S. Government's reserve assets, liabilities to foreigners, and its international financial position.

Table IFS-1 shows reserve assets of the United States, including gold stock and special drawing rights held in the Special Drawing Account in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The table also shows U.S. reserve holdings and holdings of convertible foreign currencies in the IMF.

Table IFS-2 contains statistics on liabilities to foreign official institutions, and selected liabilities to all other foreigners, which are used in the United States balance of payments statistics.

Table IFS-3 shows nonmarketable bonds and notes that Treasury issues to official institutions and other residents of foreign countries. The figures are in dollars or dollar equivalents.

Table IFS-4 presents the general foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar. Values presented are broader than those provided by single exchange rate levels and do not claim to represent a guide to measuring the impact of exchange rate levels on United States international transactions. Indices are computed as geometric averages of individual currency levels with weights derived from the share of each country's trade with the United States during the years 1982 and 1983.

1 Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) adopted a technique for valuing the special drawing right (SDR) based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and reserve position in the IMF are also valued on this basis beginning July 1974.
2 Treasury values its gold stock at $42,222 per fine troy ounce; pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5117(b) issues certificates to the Federal Reserve at the same rate against all gold held.
3 Includes allocations of SDRs in the Special Drawing Account of the International Monetary Fund, plus or minus transactions in SDRs.

4 Includes holdings of Treasury and Federal Reserve System; beginning November 1978, these are valued at current market exchange rates or, where appropriate, at such other rates as may be agreed upon by the parties to the transactions.
5 The United States has the right to purchase foreign currencies equivalent to its reserve position in the Fund automatically if needed. Under appropriate conditions the United States could purchase additional amounts related to the U.S. quota.

Exchange rates are drawn from the International Monetary Fund's "International Financial Statistics" when available.
2 Index includes average annual rates as reported in "International Financial Statistics."

Note--These indices are presented to provide measures of the general foreign exchange value of the dollar that are broader than those provided by single exchange rate levels. They do not purport to represent a guide to measuring the impact of exchange rate levels on U.S. international transactions. The indices are computed as geometric averages of individual currency levels with weights derived from the share of each country's trade with the United States during 1982-83.

INTRODUCTION: Capital Movements

Treasury collects information about capital movements, or the transferrence of assets between the United States and other countries, and has since 1935. Commercial banks and other depository institutions, bank holding companies, securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States file capital movement reports with district Federal Reserve banks.

Forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System, and of consultations with representatives of banks, securities firms, and nonbanking enterprises. The revised capital movements reporting forms and instructions used in the Treasury International Capital (TIC) Reporting System became effective with the banking reports as of April 30, 1978, and with the nonbanking reports as of December 31 of the same year.

In general, information is reported opposite the country or geographical area where the foreigner is located, as shown on the records of reporting institutions. However, the information may not always reflect the ultimate ownership of the assets. Reporting institutions are not required to go beyond the addresses shown on their records, and so may not be aware of the actual country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary.

United States liabilities arising from the deposits of dollars with foreign banks appear as liabilities to foreign banks, although the liability of the foreign bank receiving the deposit may be to foreign official institutions or to residents of another country.

Information on branches or agencies of foreign official institutions is reported opposite the country to which the entire institution itself belongs. Likewise, information pertaining to international and regional organizations is reported in the same way. The exception to this is information concerning the Bank for International Settlements, which is classified under "Other Europe."

Banks and other depository institutions, bank holding companies, International Banking Facilities (IBFs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States must file reports. These enterprises include the branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and other affiliates in the United States of foreign banking and nonbanking firms. Those with liabilities, claims, or securities transactions below specified exemption levels are exempt from reporting.

Banks and other depository institutions, and some brokers and dealers, file monthly reports covering their dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, foreigners in a number of countries. Twice a year, June 30 and December 31, they also report the same liabilities and claims items to foreigners in countries not shown separately on the monthly reports. Quarterly reports are filed for liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies in relation to foreigners. The exemption level applicable to these banking reports is $15 million.

Banks and other depository institutions, securities brokers and dealers, and other enterprises report monthly their transactions with foreigners in long-term securities. Effective January 31, 1991, reports are required for purchases and sales exceeding $2 million during the covered month.

Exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions and other banks and depository institutions, brokers, and other nonbanking enterprises file reports quarterly if liabilities to, or claims on, unaffiliated foreigners amount to $10 million or more.

Nonbanking enterprises also report each month their U.S. dollar-denominated deposit and certificates of deposit claims of $10 million or more on banks abroad.

The data in these tables do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and other countries. The principal exclusions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies, and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce in its regular reports on the United States balance of payments.

Section I presents liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks and other depository institutions, as well as brokers and dealers. Dollar liabilities are reported monthly; those denominated in foreign currencies are reported quarterly. Respondents report certain of their own liabilities and all of their custody liabilities to foreigners. Savings and loan associations and other thrift institutions have filed the TIC banking forms since January 1985.

Section II presents claims on foreigners that are also reported by U.S. banks and other depository institutions, brokers, and dealers. Data on bank claims held for their own account are collected monthly. Information on claims held for their domestic customers, as well as foreign currency claims, is collected on a quarterly basis only. Maturity data are reported according to time remaining to maturity. Reporting also covers certain items held by brokers and dealers in the United States.

In Section III are supplementary statistics on U.S. banks' liabilities to, and claims on, foreigners. The supplementary data on bank loans and credits to nonbank foreigners combine selected information from the TIC reports with data from the monthly Federal Reserve 2502 reports submitted for major foreign branches of U.S. banks. Other supplementary data on U.S. bank dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, countries not regularly reported separately are available in the June and December issues of the Treasury Bulletin.

Section IV shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions other than banks, other depository institutions, brokers, and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Information does not include accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. These are reported by business enterprises to the Department of Commerce on its direct investment forms. The data also exclude claims held through U.S. banks.

Section V contains information on transactions in all types of long-term domestic and foreign securities with foreigners reported by banks, brokers, and other entities in the United States. The data cover new security issues, transactions in outstanding issues, and redemptions of securities. They also include transactions executed in the United States for the account of foreigners, transactions executed abroad for the account of reporting institutions and their domestic customers, and some transactions classified as direct investments in the balance of payments accounts. This, however, does not include nonmarketable Treasury bonds and notes, foreign series, and foreign currency series, shown in table IFS-3.

The geographical breakdown of the data on securities transactions shows the country of domicile of their foreign buyers and sellers. In the case of outstanding issues, this may differ from the country of the original issuer. The gross figures contain some offsetting transactions between foreigners; the net figures for total transactions represent transactions by foreigners with United States residents. However, net figures for transactions of individuals in countries and areas may include some transactions between foreigners of different countries.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

Information on holdings of foreign currencies, or foreign currency positions, of banks and nonbanking firms in the United States has been collected since 1974. It has also been collected on those of foreign branches, majority-owned foreign partnerships and subsidiaries of United States banks and nonbanking firms.

Reports cover five major foreign exchange market currencies and U.S. dollars held abroad. This information is published in the Treasury Bulletin in seven sections. FCP-IIa is a summary of worldwide net positions in all of the currencies reported. FCP-II through -VI present information on specified foreign currencies. FCP-VII presents the U.S. dollar positions of the foreign branches and subsidiaries of U.S. firms that are required to report in one or more of the specified foreign currencies. Reporting is required by title II of Public Law 93-110, which is an amendment to the Par Value Modification Act of September 21, 1973, and by implementing Treasury regulations.

Information for the United States includes amounts reported by sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations in the United States, including the U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign nonbanking concerns. The Weekly Bank Positions category includes figures reported by agencies, branches, and subsidiaries of foreign banks as well as banking institutions located in the United States. Data for "foreign branches" and "abroad" include amounts reported by the branches and by majority-owned partnerships and subsidiaries of U.S. banking and nonbanking concerns.

Data generally do not reflect the foreign currency positions of foreign parents' or their subsidiaries located abroad except through intercompany accounts. The data do include the foreign subsidiaries of a few foreign-owned U.S. corporations. Assets, liabilities, and foreign exchange contract data are reported based on time remaining to maturity as of the date of the report, regardless of the original maturity of the instrument involved.

Since January 1982, the exemption level for banks and banking institutions is $100 million. The exemption level for nonbanking firms is also $100 million on positions in the United States, and on foreign branch and subsidiaries' positions since March 1982.

Firms must report their entire position in a foreign currency if the specified U.S. dollar equivalent exemption level is exceeded in any category of assets, liabilities, exchange contracts bought and sold, or in the net position of that currency.

In general, exemption levels are applied to the entire firm. In reports on their foreign branches and majority-owned partnerships and subsidiaries, U.S. banks and nonbanks are required to report the U.S. dollar-denominated assets, liabilities, exchange contracts bought and sold, and net positions of those branches, partnerships, and subsidiaries with nonexempt holdings in the specified foreign currencies.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established under the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (31 U.S.C. 822a), which authorized establishment of a Treasury Department fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose somewhat to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Resources of the fund include dollar balances, partially invested in U.S. Government securities, Special drawing rights (SDRs), and balances of foreign currencies. Principal sources of income (losses) for the fund are profits (losses) on SDRs and foreign exchange, as well as interest earned on assets.

Table ESF-1 presents the assets, liabilities, and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents based on current exchange rates computed according to the accrual method of accounting. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the IMF. Gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income (loss) account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations by quarter. Figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents computed according to the accrual method. "Profit (loss) on foreign exchange" includes realized profits or losses on currencies held. "Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations" reflects net gain or loss on revaluation of SDR holdings and allocations for the quarter.

INTRODUCTION: Airport and Airway Trust Fund

The airport and airway trust fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal 1971, according to provisions of the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 (49 U.S.C. 1742(a)). The trust fund was reestablished in the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 9502 and 9602(b)) as a result of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-248, dated September 3, 1982), effective September 1, 1982.

Amounts equivalent to the taxes received in the Treasury on transportation by air, gasoline, and jet fuel used in noncommercial aircraft, freight moved by aircraft, and an international departure tax are appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund.

These transfers are made at least quarterly based on of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to adjustments in later transfers in the amount of actual tax receipts.

When the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 9602(b) are met, amounts

available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in public debt securities with the interest credited to the fund. Additional sums from the general fund are also credited, as authorized and made available by law, if necessary to meet outlay requirements.

Amounts required for outlays to carry out the airport and airway program are made available to the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation.

Other charges to the trust fund are made by the Secretary of the Treasury for transfers of certain refunds of taxes and certain section 39 credits of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

Annual reports to Congress, required by 26 U.S.C. 9602(a), are submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and those expected during the next 5 fiscal years.

TRUST FUND REPORTS

INTRODUCTION: Asbestos Trust Fund

The asbestos trust fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal 1987 according to Public Law 99-519, October 22, 1986. It consists of amounts received in the Treasury on or after January 1, 1987, as repayments of loans made under section 505 of the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Act of 1984 (20 U.S.C. 4011 et seq.), and amounts received as deposits from local educational agencies (LEAs) under section 207(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Amounts available in the fund exceeding current outlay requirements have been invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, and any interest earned and proceeds from sale or redemption have been credited to the fund. Beginning in fiscal 1992,

the Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that all interest earned, repayments, and civil penalties collected from LEAs for loans made prior to fiscal 1992, be deposited into a liquidating account that will then be deposited into a miscellaneous receipts account at Treasury.

Repayments collected for loans made in fiscal 1992 and fiscal years thereafter will be directly deposited into the miscellaneous receipts account.

Annual reports to the Congress are required of the Secretary of the Treasury each year on the financial condition and results of the operations of the trust fund for the preceding fiscal year and on its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

TRUST FUND REPORTS

INTRODUCTION: Black Lung Disability Trust Fund

The black lung disability trust fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal 1978 according to the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977. Public Law 97-119, December 29, 1981, entitled "Trust Fund Code of 1981" (26 U.S.C. 9501), provides for the continuation of the fund as previously established under section 3 of the act of 1977.

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272), enacted April 7, 1986, provided for an increase in the coal tax effective April 1, 1986, through December 31, 1995, and a 5-year forgiveness of interest retroactive to October 1, 1985.

The 5-year moratorium on interest payments ended on September 30, 1990. Payment of interest on advances resumed in fiscal 1991. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-203), signed December 22, 1987, extends the temporary increase in the coal tax through December 31, 2013.

The Act designates the following receipts to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund: excise taxes on mined coal tonnage; taxable expenditures of private black lung benefit trusts; reimbursements by responsible mine operators; and related fines, penalties, and interest charges.

Estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury determine monthly transfers of amounts for excise taxes to the trust fund, subject to adjustments in later transfers to actual tax receipts.

After retirement of the current indebtedness, amounts available in the fund exceeding current expenditure requirements will be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing public debt securities. Any interest earned is credited to the fund. Also credited, if necessary, are repayable advances from the general fund to meet outlay requirements exceeding available revenues.

To carry out the program, amounts are made available to the Department of Labor. Other charges to the fund are to pay administrative expenses incurred by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury, and also to repay advances from the general fund and interest on advances.

The act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual report to Congress after consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (26 U.S.C. 9602 (a)). The report must present the financial condition and results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and the expected condition and operations of the fund during the next 5 fiscal years.

TRUST FUND REPORTS

INTRODUCTION: Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund

The harbor maintenance trust fund was established on the books of the Treasury on April 1, 1987, according to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-962, November 17, 1986) (26 U.S.C. 9505).

The harbor maintenance trust fund consists of such amounts as may be appropriated provided by section 9505(b), transferred by the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) according to section 13(a) of the Act of May 13, 1954, or credited as provided in section 9602(b). Amounts are appropriated equivalent to the taxes received in the Treasury under section 4461 (relating to harbor maintenance tax).

Amounts in the harbor maintenance trust fund are available as provided by appropriation acts for making expenditures to carry out section 210(a) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, for payments of rebates of tolls or charges according to section 13(b) of the Act of May 13, 1954 (as in effect on April 1, 1987), and for the payment of all expenses of administration incurred by the Department of the Treasury in administering subchapter A of chapter 36 (relating to harbor maintenance tax), but not exceeding $5 million for any fiscal year and for periods during which no fee applies under paragraph (9) or (10) of section 1303(1(a) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.

The provision in the act for payment of the expenses of the

administration costs from this source has been found to be in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Therefore, legislation has been proposed to authorize payment from the trust fund itself of expenses up to $5 million annually to the Department of the Army for administration costs of the Army, the Department of Commerce, and Treasury.

The harbor maintenance user fee was increased by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508, approved November 5, 1990). The ad valorem user fee imposed on applicable commercial cargo increased from 0.04 percent to 0.125 percent. The Water Resources Development Act of 1990 increased to 100 percent the amount of the harbor maintenance costs that can be financed by the trust fund. Legislation is also being proposed in fiscal 1992 to authorize payment of $45.5 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which was included in calculating the 0.125 percent ad valorem rate.

Annual reports to Congress are required by 26 U.S.C. 9505 to be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. These reports are required to cover the financial condition and the results of operations of the fund during the past fiscal year and its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

INTRODUCTION: Hazardous Substance Superfund

The hazardous substance response trust fund was established on the books of the Treasury in fiscal 1981, in accordance with provisions of the Hazardous Substance Response Revenue Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9631 (a)). Effective fiscal 1987, the trust was reestablished as the hazardous substance superfund (superfund) in accordance with provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 (Public Law 96-510), as amended by Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 (Public Law 99-499, dated Oct. 17, 1986).

The Internal Revenue Service collects excise taxes on petroleum and chemicals, and an environmental tax from all corporations with modified alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) in excess of $2 million. In addition, the superfund is authorized to be appropriated general revenues from the general fund not otherwise appropriated. Cost recoveries and other miscellaneous receipts (e.g., interest revenue) are deposited directly to the superfund. Also appropriated

to the superfund, if required, are repayable advances from the general fund to meet outlay requirements in excess of available revenues. Amounts available in the superfund, in excess of current expenditure requirements, are invested by the Secretary of the Treasury in interest-bearing Government securities (e.g.,Treasury bills). All interest earned is credited directly to the superfund

To carry out the superfund program, amounts are appropriated from the superfund to the Environmental Protection Agency for programmatic and administrative expenses, repayment of advances to the general fund, and interest expense associated with outstanding advances from the general fund.

An annual report to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury is required by section 9633(b)(1) of CERCLA, as amended.

TRUST FUND REPORTS

INTRODUCTION: Highway Trust Fund

The highway trust fund was originally established on the books of the Treasury according to provisions of the Highway Revenue Act of 1957, as amended (23 U.S.C. 12 note). It was reestablished on the books of the Treasury by the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as modified by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369, approved July 18, 1984), and subsequently by the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987. Amounts equivalent to taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, special motor fuels, tires, tubes, tread rubber, commercial motor vehicles, truck use, lubricating oil, and parts and accessories for trucks, buses, etc., are designated by the Act to be appropriated and transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust fund. These transfers are made at least monthly based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to adjustments in later transfers to the amount of actual tax receipts. Amounts available in the fund exceeding outlay requirements are invested in public debt securities and interest is credited to the fund. There are also credited to the fund repayable advances from the general fund, as authorized and made available by law, to meet outlay requirements exceeding available revenues during a portion of a fiscal year, if necessary.

The termination date of the fund was extended to September 30, 1993, as a result of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Reloca-

tion Assistance Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-17, approved April 2, 1987). Within the fund is a mass transit account, funded by one-ninth of the excise tax collections under sections 4041 and 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) imposed after March 31, 1983. The funds from this account shall be used for expenditures according to section 21(a)(2) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. The remaining excise taxes collected shall be included in a highway account within the trust fund, and expenditures for this account shall be made according to the provisions of Public Law 97-424.

Amounts required for outlays to carry out the Federal aid highway program are made available to the Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation. Other charges to the trust fund are made by the Secretary of the Treasury for transfers of certain taxes to the land and water conservation fund and to the aquatic resources trust fund, refunds of certain taxes, repayments of advances from the general fund, and the interest on advances.

Annual reports to Congress are required by 26 U.S.C. 9602 (a), Internal Revenue Code as amended, to be submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation. These reports cover the financial condition and the results of operations of the fund for the past fiscal year and its expected condition and operations during the next 5 fiscal years.

Glossary

Expanded, With References to Applicable Sections and Tables

Accrued discount (SBN-1, -2, -3)—Interest that accumulates on savings bonds from the date of purchase until the date of redemption or final maturity, whichever comes first. Series A, B, C, D, E, EE, F, and J are discount or accrual type bonds—meaning principal and interest are paid when bonds are redeemed. Series G, H, HH, and K are current-income bonds, and the semiannual interest paid to their holders is not included in accrued discount.

Amounts outstanding and in circulation (USCC)--Includes all issues by the Bureau of the Mint purposely intended as a medium of exchange. Coins sold by the Bureau of the Mint at premium prices are excluded; however, uncirculated coin sets sold at face value plus handling charge are included.

Average discount rate (PDO-2, -3)-In Treasury bill auctions, purchasers tender competitive bids on a discount rate basis. The average discount rate is the weighted, or adjusted, average of all bids accepted in the auction.

Budget authority ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Congress passes laws giving budget authority to Government entities, which gives the agencies the power to spend Federal funds. Congress can stipulate various criteria for the spending of these funds. For example, Congress can stipulate that a given agency must spend within a specific year, number of years, or any time in the future.

The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, authority to borrow, and contract authority. The period of time during which Congress makes funds available may be specified as 1-year, multiple-year, or no-year. The available amount may be classified as either definite or indefinite; a specific amount or an unspecified amount can be made available. Authority may also be classified as current or permanent. Permanent authority requires no current action by Congress.

Budget deficit--The total, cumulative amount by which budget outlays (spending) exceed budget receipts (income).

Capital ("Federal Obligations")--Assets, such as land, equipment, and financial reserves.

Cash management bills (PDO-2)--Marketable Treasury bills of irregular maturity lengths, sold periodically to fund short-term cash needs of Treasury. Their sale, having higher minimum and multiple purchase requirements than those of other issues, is generally restricted to competitive bidders.

Competitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—A bid to purchase a stated amount of one issue of Treasury securities at a specified yield or discount. The bid is accepted if it is within the range accepted in the auction. (See noncompetitive tenders.)

Coupon Issue--The issue of bonds or notes (public debt).

Currency no longer Issued (USCC)—Old and new series gold and silver certificates, Federal Reserve notes, national bank notes, and 1890 Series Treasury notes.

Current Income bonds ("U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes")-Bonds paying semiannual interest to holders. Interest is not included in accrued discount.

Debt outstanding subject to limitation (FD-6)—The debt incurred by the Treasury subject to the statutory limit set by Congress. Until World War I, a specific amount of debt was authorized to each separate security issue. Beginning with the Second Liberty Loan

Act of 1917, the nature of the limitation was modified, until in 1941, it developed into an overall limit on the outstanding Federal debt. In 1991, the debt limit was $4,145,000 million; the limit may change from year to year.

The debt subject to limitation includes most of Treasury's public debt except of securities issued to the Federal Financing Bank, upon which there is a limitation of $15 billion, and certain categories of older debt (totaling approximately $595 million as of February 1991).

Discount--The interest deducted in advance when purchasing notes or bonds. (see Accrued discount)

Discount rate (PDO-2)--The difference between par value and the actual purchase price paid, annualized over a 360-day year. Because this rate is less than the actual yield (coupon-equivalent rate), the yield should be used in any comparison with coupon issue securities.

Dollar coins (USCC)--Dollar coins include standard silver and nonsilver coins.

Domestic series (FD-2)—Nonmarketable, interest and non-interest-bearing securities issued periodically by Treasury to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RFC) for investment of funds authorized under section 21B of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441b).

Federal Intrafund transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations") -Intrabudgetary transactions in which payments and receipts both occur within the same Federal fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds).

Federal Reserve notes (USCC)--Issues by the U.S. Government to the public through the Federal Reserve banks and their member banks. They represent money owed by the Government to the public. Currently, the item "Federal Reserve notes--amounts outstanding" consists of new series issues. The Federal Reserve note is the only class of currency currently issued.

Foreign ("Foreign Currency Positions," IFS-2, -3)--(international) Locations other than those included under the definition of the United States. (See United States.)

Foreigner ("Capital Movements," IFS-2)—All institutions and individuals living outside the United States, including U.S. citizens living abroad, and branches, subsidiaries, and other affiliates abroad of U.S. banks and business concerns; central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of countries other than the United States, and international and regional organizations, wherever located. Also, refers to persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting for foreigners.

Foreign public borrower ('Capital Movements')--Central governments and departments of central governments of foreign countries and of their possessions; foreign central banks, stabilization funds, and exchange authorities, corporations and other agencies of central governments, including development banks and institutions, and other agencies that are majority-owned by the central government or its departments. Also included are state, provincial, and local governments of foreign countries, and their departments and agencies; and any international or regional organization or subordinate or affiliate, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states.

Glossary, Con.

Foreign-targeted issue (PDO-1,-3)—Foreign-targeted issues were notes sold between October 1984 and February 1986 to foreign institutions, foreign branches of U.S. institutions, foreign central banks or monetary authorities, or to international organizations in which the United States held membership. Sold as companion issues, they could be converted to domestic (normal) Treasury notes with the same maturity and interest rates. Interest was paid annually rather than semiannually.

Fractional coins (USCC)--Coins minted in denominations of 50, 25, and 10 cents, and minor coins (5 cents and 1 cent).

Government account series (FD-2)—Certain trust fund statutes require the Secretary of the Treasury to apply monies held by these funds toward the issuance of nonmarketable special securities. These securities are sold directly by Treasury to a specific Government agency, trust fund, or account. Their rate is based on an average of market yields on outstanding Treasury obligations, and they may be redeemed at the option of the holder. Roughly 80 percent of these are issued to five holders: the Federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund; the civil service retirement and disability fund; the Federal hospital insurance trust fund; the military retirement fund; and the unemployment trust fund.

International Monetary Fund ("Exchange Stabilization Fund" IFS-1)--(IMF) Established by the United Nations, the IMF promotes international trade, stability of exchange, and monetary cooperation. Members are allowed to draw from the fund.

Interfund transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")--Transactions in which payments are made from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in another group.

Intrabudgetary transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Intrabudgetary transactions occur when payment and receipt both occur within the budget, or when payment is made from off-budget Federal entities whose budget authority and outlays are excluded from the budget totals.

Majority-owned foreign subsidiaries ("Foreign Currency Positions")--Foreign corporations in which one or more nonbanking business concerns or nonprofit institutions located in the United States, directly or indirectly, owns stock with more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power, or more than 50 percent of the total value of all classes of stock.

Matured non-interest-bearing debt (SBN-1, -2, -3)-The value of outstanding savings bonds and notes that have reached final maturity and no longer earn interest. This includes all Series A-D, F, G, J, and K bonds. Series E bonds (issued between May 1941 and November 1965) have a final maturity of 30 years, as do Series EE (issued since January 1980). Series H (issued from June 1952 through December 1979), and savings notes issued between May 1967 and October 1970. Series HH bonds (issued since January 1980) mature after 20 years.

Noncompetitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—Offers by an investor to purchase Treasury securities at the price equivalent to the weighted average discount rate or yield of accepted competitive tenders in a Treasury auction. Noncompetitive tenders are always accepted in full.

Obligation ("Federal Obligations")--An unpaid commitment to acquire goods or services.

Off-budget Federal entities ("Federal Fiscal Operations")- Federally owned and controlled entities whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals under provisions of law. Their receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit are not included in budget receipts, outlays, or deficits. Their budget authority is not included in the totals of the budget.

Outlays--(expenditures, net disbursements) Payments on obligations in the form of cash, checks, the issuance of bonds or notes, or the maturing of interest coupons.

Par value--The face value of bonds or notes, including interest.

Quarterly financing ("Treasury Financing Operations")— Treasury has historically offered packages of several "coupon" security issues on the 15th of February, May, August, and November, or on the next working day. These issues currently consist of a 3-year note, a 10-year note, and a 30-year bond. Treasury sometimes offers additional amounts of outstanding long-term notes or bonds, rather than selling new security issues (See reopening.)

Receipts ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Funds collected from selling land, capital, or services, as well as collections from the public (budget receipts), such as taxes, fines, duties, and fees.

Reopening (PDO-3, -4)-The offer for sale of additional amounts of outstanding issues, rather than an entirely new issue. A reopened issue will always have the same maturity date, CUSIP number, and interest rate as the original issue.

Short-term ("Foreign Currency Positions")--Securities maturing in 1 year or less.

Special drawing rights ("Exchange Stabilization Fund," IFS-1) - (SDRs) International assets created by IMF that serve to increase international liquidity and provide additional international reserves. They may be purchased and sold among eligible holders through IMF. (See IMF)

SDR allocations are the counterpart to SDRs issued by IMF based on members' quotas in IMF. Although shown in exchange stabilization fund (ESF) statements as liabilities, they must be redeemed by ESF only in the event of liquidation of, or United States withdrawal from, the SDR department of IMF or cancellation of SDRs.

SDR certificates are issued to the Federal Reserve System against SDRs when SDRs are legalized as money. Proceeds of monetization are deposited into an ESF account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

State and local government series (FD-2)—(SLUGS) Special nonmarketable certificates, notes, and bonds offered to State and local governments as a means to invest proceeds from their own tax-exempt financing. Interest rates and maturities comply with IRS arbitrage provisions. SLUGS are offered in both time deposit and demand deposit forms. Time deposit certificates have maturities of up to 1 year. Notes mature in 1 to 10 years and bonds mature in more than 10 years. Demand deposit securities are 1-day certificates rolled over with a rate adjustment daily.

Statutory debt limit (FD-6)—By Act of Congress there is a limit, either temporary or permanent, on the amount of public debt that may be outstanding. When this limit is reached, the Treasury may not sell new debt issues until Congress increases or extends the limit. For a detailed listing of the changes in the limit since 1941;

159

refer to the Budget of the United States Government. (See debt outstanding subject to limitation.)

STRIPS (PDO-1, -3)-Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Long-term notes and bonds may be divided into principal and interest-paying components, which may be transferred and sold in amounts as small as $1,000. STRIPS are sold at auction at a minimum par amount, varying for each issue. The amount is an arithmetic function of the issue's interest rate.

Treasury bills--The shortest term Federal security (maturity dates normally varying from 3 to 12 months), they are sold at a discount.

Trust fund transaction ("Federal Fiscal Operations")--An intra-

budgetary transaction in which both payments and receipts occur within the same trust fund group.

Profile of the Economy
Real Disposable Personal Income and real spending were soft in the final months of the year. Income rose at an annual rate of .5 percent in the 4th quarter, contributing to a narrow increase in real spendable income for all households. At the same time, real consumer spending fell at an annual rate in the 4th quarter as a result of a decline in spending for services was offset by a 0.3 percent increase in purchases of goods. For the year, real spending was up by just 0.3 percent.
