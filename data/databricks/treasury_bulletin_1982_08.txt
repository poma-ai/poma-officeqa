Treasury Bills (Other than Cash Management Bills) - General

Treasury bills are sold on a discount basis under competitive and noncompetitive bidding, and at maturity their par amount is payable without interest. All series are issued entirely in book-entry form in a minimum amount of $10,000 and in any higher $5,000 multiple, on the records either of the Federal Reserve banks and branches, or of the Department of the Treasury.

Tenders are received at Federal Reserve banks and branches and from individuals at the Bureau of the Public Debt, Washington. Each tender must be for a minimum of $10,000. Tenders over $10,000 must be in multiples of $5,000. Payment for the full par amount applied for must accompany all tenders submitted for bills to be maintained on the book-entry records of the Department of the Treasury. A cash adjustment will be made for the difference between the par payment submitted and the actual issue price as determined in the auction. No deposit need accompany tenders from incorporated banks and trust companies and from responsible and recognized dealers in investment securities for bills to be maintained on the book-entry records of Federal Reserve banks and branches. A deposit of 2 percent of the par amount of the bills applied for must accompany tenders for such bills from others, unless an express guaranty of payment by an incorporated bank or trust company accompanies the tenders.

Noncompetitive tenders (without stated price), usually for $500,000 or less from any one bidder, for each issue of 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week bills, are accepted in full at the weighted average price of accepted competitive bids for an issue.

Payment for accepted tenders must be made or completed on the date of issue, in cash or other immediately available funds or in a like par amount of Treasury securities maturing on or before that date. Payment for 13-week, 26-week, and 52-week bills may not be made by credit in Treasury tax and loan accounts.

Treasury Bulletin

FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS

"Obligations" are the basis on which the use of funds is controlled in the Federal Government. They are recorded at the point at which the Government makes a firm commitment to acquire goods or services and are the first of the four key events—order, delivery, payment, consumption—which characterize the acquisition and use of resources. In general, they consist of orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions requiring the disbursement of money.

The obligatory stage of Government transactions is a strategic point in gauging the impact of the Government's operations on the national economy, since it frequently represents for business firms the Government commitment which stimulates business investment, including inventory purchases and employment of labor. Disbursements may not occur for months after the Government places its order but the order itself usually causes immediate pressure on the private economy.

Obligations are classified according to a uniform set of categories which are based upon the nature of the transaction without regard to its

ultimate purpose. All payments for salaries and wages, for example, are reported as personnel compensation, whether the personal services are used in current operations or in the construction of capital items.

Federal agencies and firms often do business with one another; in doing so, the "buying" agency records obligations, and the "performing" agency records reimbursements. In Table FO-1, obligations that are incurred within the Government are distinguished from those incurred outside the Government. Tables FO-2 and FO-3 show only those incurred outside.

Obligation data for the administrative budget fund accounts were first published in the September 1967 Treasury Bulletin and the trust fund accounts were first published in the October 1967 Bulletin. Beginning with the April 1968 Bulletin, the data are on the basis of the budget concepts adopted pursuant to the recommendations of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts.

Source: Reports on Obligations, Standard Form 225, from agencies. 1/ For Federal budget presentation a concept of "net obligations incurred" is generally used. This concept eliminates transactions within the Government and revenue and reimbursements from the public which by statute may be used by Government agencies without appropriation action by the Congress. Summary figures on this basis follow. (Data are on the basis of Reports on Obligations received from the agencies prior to reports submitted for budget

presentation and therefore may differ somewhat from the Budget of the U.S. Government.) Gross obligations incurred (as above) 404,283 Deduct: Advances, reimbursements, other income, etc. -65,187 Offsetting receipts -41,403

Treasury Bulletin

ACCOUNT OF THE U.S. TREASURY

Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The operating cash of the Treasury is maintained in Treasury's accounts with the Federal Reserve banks and branches and in tax and loan accounts. As the balances in the accounts at the Federal Reserve banks become depleted, they are restored by calling in (withdrawing) funds from thousands of financial institutions throughout the country authorized to maintain tax and loan accounts.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147, the Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositaries maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan investment program, depositary financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate in the program. Depositaries that wish to retain funds deposited in their tax and loan accounts in interest-bearing obligations participate under the Note Option; depositaries that wish to remit the funds to the Treasury's account at Federal Reserve banks participate under the Remittance Option.

Deposits to tax and loan accounts occur in the normal course of business under a uniform procedure applicable to all financial institutions whereby customers of financial institutions deposit with them tax payments and funds for the purchase of Government securities. In most cases the transaction involves merely the transfer of funds from a customer's account to the tax and loan account in the same financial institution. On occasions, to the extent authorized by the Treasury, financial institutions are permitted to deposit in these accounts proceeds from subscriptions to public debt securities entered for their own account as well as for the accounts of their customers.

The tax and loan system permits the Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in Note Option depositories and in the financial communities in which they arise until such time as the Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way the Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuation operations on Note Option financial institution reserves and the economy.

Source: Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States; Office of Market Analysis, United States Savings Bonds Division. Note: In these tables sales of Series A-F and J bonds are included at issue price, and redemptions and amounts outstanding at current redemption value. Series G, H, HH, and K are included at face value throughout. Matured bonds which have been redeemed are included in redemptions. Matured E, H, J, and K bonds outstanding are included in the interest-bearing debt until all bonds of the annual series have matured, and are then transferred to matured debt on which interest has ceased.
1/ Sales and redemption figures include exchange of minor amounts of (1) matured Series E bonds for Series G and K bonds from May 1951 through April 1957; (2) Series F and J bonds for Series H bonds beginning January 1960; and (3) U.S. savings notes for Series H bonds beginning January 1972; however, they exclude exchanges of Series E bonds for Series H and HH bonds, which are reported in Table SB-3.
2/ Details by series on a cumulative basis and by periods of Series A-D combined will be found in the February 1952 and previous issues of the Treasury Bulletin.

3/ Because there is a normal lag in classifying redemptions, the distributions of redemption between sales price and accrued discount have been estimated.
4/ Series F and G sales were discontinued April 30, 1952, and Series J and K sales were discontinued April 30, 1957. Sales figures after April 30, 1957, represent adjustments.
5/ Includes exchanges of Series 1941 F and G bonds for 3-1/4% marketable bonds of 1978-83.
Includes exchanges of Series 1948 F and G savings bonds for 4-3/4% marketable notes of 1964.
Includes exchanges of Series 1949 F and G bonds for 4% marketable bonds of 1969.
Includes exchanges of Series 1960 F and G bonds for 3-7/8% marketable bonds of 1968.
6/ Includes exchanges of Series 1951 and 1952 F and G bonds for 3-7/8% marketable bonds of 1971 and 4% marketable bonds of 1980.
7/ Represents changes in the amounts of redemptions not yet classified between matured and unmatured issues.

Treasury Bulletin

TREASURY SURVEY OF OWNERSHIP,

JUNE 30, 1982

The monthly Treasury Survey of Ownership covers securities issued by the U.S. Government, Federal agencies, federally sponsored agencies, and the District of Columbia. The banks and insurance companies included in the Survey currently account for about 80 percent of all such securities held by these institutions. The similar proportion for corporations and for savings and loan associations is 50 percent, and for State and local governments, 40 percent. Data were first published for banks and insurance companies in the May 1941 Treasury Bulletin, for corporations and savings and loan associations

in the September 1960 Bulletin, and for State and local governments in the February 1962 Bulletin.

Holdings by commercial banks distributed according to Federal Reserve member bank classes and nonmember banks are published for June 30 and December 31. Holdings by corporate pension trust funds are published quarterly, first appearing in the March 1954 Bulletin.

1/ Treasury bond yields are based on a composite of closing bid quotations in the over-the-counter market. Series includes bonds on which the interest income is subject to normal tax and surtax which are neither due nor callable before 10 years. For bonds currently in series, see Table MQ-3.
2/ Treasury series based on reoffering yields of new corporate bonds rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and having an original maturity of at least 20 years. Prior to June 1973, this series reflected bond without call protection. From June 1973 to July 1976, the series was

adjusted to reflect 5 years call protection. Since that time the series reflects bond yields regardless of the call protection offered. 3/ Index of new reoffering yields on 20 years general obligations rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service. Prior to June 1970, the series was compiled by Securities Industries Association. Since then, the series has been compiled by Treasury. 4/ One or more new long-term bonds added to the average. 5/ An existing bond dropped from the long-term bond average. n.a. Not available.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL STATISTICS

The tables in this section are designed to provide data on U.S. reserve assets and liabilities and other statistics related to the U.S. balance of payments and international financial position.

Table IFS-1 shows the reserve assets of the United States, including its gold stock, special drawing rights held in the Special Drawing Account in the International Monetary Fund, holdings of convertible foreign currencies, and reserve position in the International Monetary Fund.

Table IFS-2 brings together statistics on liabilities to foreign official institutions, and selected liabilities to all other foreigners, which are used in the U.S. balance of payments statistics.

Table IFS-3 (formerly Table IFS-4) shows U.S. Treasury nonmarketable bonds and notes issued to official institutions and other residents of foreign countries.

Table IFS-4 (formerly Table IFS-6) presents a measure of weighted-average changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of certain other countries.

1/ Beginning July 1974, the IMF adopted a technique for valuing the special drawing right (SDR) based on a weighted-average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and reserve position in the IMF are also valued on this basis beginning July 1974.
2/ Includes gold sold to the United States by the International Monetary Fund with the right of repurchase, and gold deposited by the International Monetary Fund to mitigate the impact on the U.S. gold stock of foreign purchases for the purpose of making gold subscriptions to the Fund under quota increases.
3/ Includes gold held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). See "Account of the U.S. Treasury," Table UST-3.
4/ Includes allocations of SDR's in the Special Drawing Account in the International Monetary Fund, plus or minus transactions in SDR's.

Allocations of SDR's on January 1 of respective years are as follows: 1970, $867 million; 1971, $717 million; 1972, $710 million; 1979, 874 million (in SDR terms); 1980, 874 million (in SDR terms); and 1981, 857 million (in SDR terms). 
5/ Includes holdings of Treasury and Federal Reserve System; beginning November 1978, these are valued at current market exchange rates or, where appropriate, as such other rates as may be agreed upon by the parties to the transactions.
6/ The United States has the right to purchase foreign currencies equivalent to its reserve position in the Fund automatically if needed. Under appropriate conditions the United States could purchase additional amounts related to the U.S. quota.

This table presents calculations of weighted average percentage changes in the rates of exchange between the dollar and certain foreign currencies, in order to provide a measure of changes in the dollar's general foreign exchange value broader than a measure provided by any single exchange rate change. Calculations are provided for two sets of countries that account for a major share of U.S. foreign trade. U.S. bilateral trade patterns in 1972 are used as a convenient, readily available proxy for the assignment of relative weights to individual exchange rate changes, though such weights do not provide a full measure of individual currencies' relative importance in U.S. international transactions because they take no account of factors other than trade. The calculations do not purport to represent a guide to measuring the impact of exchange rate changes on U.S. international transactions. Exchange rate data used in constructing the indices reported here differ somewhat from those used in earlier calculations to more accurately reflect end-of-period currency values.

The equations used are as follows:
Equation one is used to calculate a trade-weighted average of changes in the dollar cost of foreign currencies:
(EQ1) E_m = E(Δ$/fc_i * M_i/ΣM)
Where: E_m is the weighted average of percentage changes in the dollar cost of individual foreign currencies;
Δ$/fc_i is the percent change in the dollar cost of foreign currency i; and
M_i/ΣM is U.S. imports from country i, as a proportion of total U.S. imports from all countries in the set.

Equation two is used to calculate a trade-weighted average of changes in the foreign exchange cost of dollars: 
(EQ2) E_X = Σ(Δfc_i/$ * X_i/EX)
Where: E_X is the weighted average of percentage changes in the foreign currency cost of dollars;
Δfc_i/$ is the percent change in the foreign currency i cost of dollars; and
X_i/EX is U.S. exports to country i, as a proportion of total U.S. exports to all countries in the set.
Equation three combines the above export-weighted and import-weighted averages to provide an overall measure of exchange rate change: 
(EQ3) E = [(E_m * m/m+x)*(-1)] + [E_X * x/m+x]
Where: m/m+x is U.S. imports as a proportion of its total trade with all countries in the set; and
x/m+x is U.S. exports as a proportion of its total trade with all countries in the set.
/ Australia, Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom.

Treasury Bulletin

CAPITAL MOVEMENTS

Background

Data relating to capital movements between the United States and foreign countries have been collected since 1935 under Treasury regulations pursuant to Executive Orders Nos. 6560 of January 15, 1934, and 10033 of February 8, 1949, and the International Investment Survey Act of 1976. Reports are filed with Federal Reserve banks by banks, bank holding companies, securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Statistics on the principal types of data by country or geographical area are then consolidated and are published in the monthly Treasury Bulletin.

The reporting forms and instructions I/ have been in the Treasury International Capital (TIC) Reporting System have been revised a number of times to meet changing conditions and to increase the usefulness of the published statistics. Revisions to the reporting forms are part of an ongoing effort to ensure the adequacy of the Treasury capital movements statistics for analysis and policy formulation with respect to the international financial position of the United States and on movements of capital between the United States and foreign countries. Revised forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultations with representatives of banks, securities firms, and nonbanking enterprises.

Major revisions of the TIC B-series forms, filed by banks and some brokers in the United States, became effective with reports as of April 30, 1978; new data series were introduced in the July 1978 Treasury Bulletin. Also, effective March 1981, reporting coverage of the B-series forms was enlarged to include holdings by brokers and dealers of certain types of short-term money market instruments. Substantial revisions of the C-series forms, filed by nonbanking enterprises, were effective with reports as of December 31, 1978; the new data series are shown beginning with the June 1979 issue. Revisions of the TIC forms that affect the format and coverage of the current Capital Movements tables are noted under "Description of Statistics" below.

Basic Definitions

The term "foreigner" as used in the Treasury reports covers all institutions and individuals domiciled outside the United States, including U.S. citizens domiciled abroad, and the foreign branches, subsidiaries, and offices of U.S. banks and business concerns; the central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of foreign countries, wherever located, and international and regional organizations, wherever located. The term "foreigner" also includes persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting on behalf of foreigners.

In general, data are reported opposite the foreign country or geographical area in which the foreigner is domiciled, as shown on the records of reporting institutions. For a number of reasons, the geographical breakdown of the reported data may not in all cases reflect the ultimate ownership of the assets. Reporting institutions are not expected to go beyond the addresses shown on their records, and so may not be aware of the country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary. Furthermore, U.S. liabilities arising from deposits of dollars with foreign banks are reported generally in the Treasury statistics as liabilities to foreign banks, whereas the liability of the foreign bank receiving the deposit may be to foreign official institutions or to residents of another country.

Data pertaining to branches or agencies of foreign official institutions are reported opposite the country to which the official institution belongs. Data pertaining to international and regional organizations are reported opposite the appropriate international or regional classification except for the Bank for International Settlements which is included in the classification "Other Europe."

Geographical Classification

A number of changes in geographical classification were introduced for most Capital Movements tables in the July 1978 issue. Several countries formerly included in "Eastern Europe" and "Other Latin American Republics" are now shown separately in the country list as well as a new category in the "international and regional" grouping for "Middle Eastern Regional" in view of the proliferation of regional financial organizations in that area, primarily in the Arab States. The remaining countries in the categories "Other Eastern Europe" and "Other Western Europe" were combined into a single "Other Europe" category; and the heading "Latin America" was retitled "Latin America and Caribbean." To the extent possible, the statistics for earlier dates have been adjusted in accordance with these revised geographical categories.

Reporting Coverage

Reports are required from banks, bank holding companies, international Banking Facilities (IBFs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States, including their branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and other affiliates in the United States of foreign firms. Entities that have reportable liabilities, claims, or securities transactions below specified exemption levels are exempt from reporting.

Banks and some brokers and dealers file reports monthly covering their dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, foreigners in a number of countries. Twice a year, as of June 30 and December 31, they also report the same liabilities and claims items with respect to foreigners in countries not shown separately on the monthly reports. Beginning with reports due as of June 30, 1978, quarterly reports are filed with respect to liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies vis-a-vis foreigners. Effective January 31, 1982, the specified exemption level applicable to the monthly and quarterly banking reports is $10 million and is based on the average for the report dates during a six-month period, including the current report

date. There is no separate exemption level for the semiannual reports.

Banks, securities brokers and dealers, and in some instances nonbanking enterprises report monthly their transactions in securities with foreigners; the applicable exemption level is $500,000 on the grand total of purchases and on the grand total of sales during the month covered by the report.

Quarterly reports are filed by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions other than banks and brokers, and other nonbanking enterprises if their liabilities to, or claims on, unaffiliated foreigners exceed a specified exemption level on a two quarter-end average basis. Effective March 31, 1982, this exemption level was set at $10 million, up from $2 million. Beginning December 31, 1978, these firms also report for each month-end their U.S. dollar-denominated deposit and certificates of deposit claims of $10 million or more on banks abroad.

Description of Statistics

Section I presents data on liabilities to foreigners reported by banks, brokers, and dealers in the United States. Beginning April 1978, the following major changes were made in the reporting coverage: amounts due to banks' own foreign offices are reported separately; a previous distinction between short-term and long-term liabilities was eliminated; a separation of the liabilities of the respondents themselves from their custody liabilities to foreigners; and foreign currency liabilities are only available quarterly. Also, beginning April 1978, the data on liabilities were made more complete by extending to securities brokers and dealers the requirement to report certain of their own liabilities and all of their custody liabilities to foreigners.

Section II presents the claims on foreigners reported by banks in the United States. Beginning with data reported as of the end of April 1978, a distinction was made between banks' claims held for their own account and claims held for their domestic customers. The former are available in a monthly series whereas the latter data are collected on a quarterly basis only. Also, the distinction in reporting of long-term and short-term components of banks' claims was discontinued. Maturity data began to be collected quarterly on a time remaining to maturity basis as opposed to the historic original maturity classification. Foreign currency claims are also collected only on a quarterly basis. Beginning March 1981, this claims coverage was extended to certain items in the hands of brokers and dealers in the United States.

Another important change in the claims reporting, beginning with new quarterly data as of June 30, 1978, was the adoption of a broadened concept of "foreign public borrower," which replaced the previous category of "foreign official institution" to produce more meaningful information on lending to the public sector of foreign countries. The term "foreign public borrower" encompasses central governments and departments of central governments of foreign countries and of their possessions; foreign central banks, stabilization funds, and exchange authorities; corporations and other agencies of central governments, including development banks, development institutions and other agencies which are majority-owned by the central government or its departments; State, provincial, and local governments of foreign countries and their departments and agencies; and any international or regional organization or subordinate or affiliated agency thereof, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states.

Section III includes supplementary statistics on U.S. banks' liabilities to, and claims on, foreigners. The supplementary data on banks' loans and credits to nonbank foreigners combine selected information from the TIC reports with data from the monthly Federal Reserve 2502 reports submitted for major foreign branches of U.S. banks. Other supplementary data on U.S. banks' dollar liabilities to, and banks' own dollar claims on, countries not regularly reported separately are available semiannually in the April and October issues of the Bulletin.

Section IV shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions other than banks and brokers, and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. The data exclude the intercompany accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. (Such transactions are reported by business enterprises to the Department of Commerce on its direct investment forms.) The data also exclude claims held through banks in the United States. Beginning with data reported as of December 31, 1978, there is separation of the financial liabilities and claims of reporting enterprises from their commercial liabilities and claims; and items are collected on a time-remaining basis instead of the prior original maturity basis. In addition, the number of reporters increased somewhat as a result of a broad canvass of prospective reporters undertaken in late 1978.

Section V contains data on transactions in all types of long-term domestic and foreign securities by foreigners as reported by banks and brokers in the United States (except nonmarketable U.S. Treasury notes, foreign series; and nonmarketable U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, foreign currency series, which are shown in the "International Financial Statistics" section, Table IFS-3). The data cover new issues of securities, transactions in outstanding issues, and redemptions of securities. They include transactions executed in the United States for the account of foreigners, and transactions executed abroad for the account of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. The data include some transactions which are classified as direct investments in the balance of payments accounts. The data exclude securities issued abroad by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, some of which are treated in the balance of payments as issues of U.S. corporations.

The geographical breakdown of the data on securities transactions shows the country of domicile of the foreign buyers and sellers of the

securities; in the case of outstanding issues, this may differ from the country of the original issuer. The gross figures contain some offsetting transactions between foreigners. The net figures for total transactions represent transactions by foreigners with U.S. residents; but the net figures for transactions of individual countries and areas may include some transactions between foreigners of different countries

The data published in these sections do not cover all types of

reported capital movements between the United States and foreign countries. The principal exclusions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies, and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce in its regular reports on the U.S. balance of payments.

1/ Copies of the reporting forms and instructions may be obtained from the Office of International Financial Reports, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220, or from district Federal Reserve banks.

NOTICE

Recent changes affecting a number of tables have been made in most Capital Movements sections of the Treasury Bulletin. Effective with the May 1982 issue, several tables in Section II and former VI were discontinued. Remaining tables in each section were renumbered accordingly.

Also beginning with the May 1982 issue, Table CM-III-1 "Dollar claims on nonbank foreigners," presents the data series reported by U.S. banks and their major foreign branches formerly shown in Table CM-III-2. The data which summarize U.S. banks' dollar liabilities to, and claims on, a supplementary list of countries will be published semiannually in the April and October issues only in new Table CM-III-2.

Effective with the June 1982 issue, selected reformattings and consolidation of several data series were introduced. Chiefly, new Table CM-II-1 replaced old Tables CM-II-2, CM-II-5, and CM-II-7 and new Table IV-1 replaced old Tables CM-IV-1 and CM-V-1. Sections IV and V were combined into new Section IV, while old Section VI was redesignated Section V.

FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS

Background

Data have been collected since 1974 on the foreign currency positions of banks and nonbanking firms in the United States, and on those of foreign branches, majority-owned foreign partnerships, and majority-owned foreign subsidiaries of U.S. banks and nonbanking firms. Reports cover eight major foreign exchange market currencies and U.S. dollars held abroad. Reporting has been required pursuant to title 11 of Public Law 93-110, an amendment to the Par Value Modification Act of September 21, 1973, and implementing Treasury regulations. Statistics on the positions have been published monthly since March 1974 beginning with data for December 1975.

The report forms and instructions used in the collection of bank data were revised effective with reports as of November 1, 1978, for the weekly reports, and as of October 31, 1978 (the last business day of the month), for the monthly reports. The most recent revision of the nonbank foreign currency forms (see below) became effective as of the last business day of September 1978. Among the changes on the forms, the Belgian franc was deleted as a reporting currency.

The monthly tables for all eight major foreign currencies have been deleted from publication beginning with the May 1982 Treasury Bulletin. All tables for the Italian lira and French franc were also deleted

Common Definitions and Concepts

The term "United States" means the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Canal Zone, Midway Island, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island. The term "foreign" means locations other than the "United States." The term "worldwide" is used to describe the sum of "United States" and "foreign" data.

Data for the United States include amounts reported by sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations in the United States including the U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign nonbanking concerns, in the case of "nonbanking firms" positions," and the agencies, branches, and subsidiaries located in the United States of foreign banks and banking institutions, in the case of the weekly and monthly "bank positions."

Data for "foreign branches" and "abroad" include amounts reported by the branches, majority-owned partnerships and majority-owned subsidiaries of U.S. banking and nonbanking concerns. In general, these data do not reflect the positions of foreign parents or foreign parents' subsidiaries located abroad except through intercompany accounts. The data include the foreign subsidiaries of a few foreign-owned U.S.-based corporations.

Assets, liabilities, and foreign exchange contract data are reported on the basis of time remaining to maturity as of the date of

the report, regardless of the original maturity of the instrument involved. "Spot" means due for receipt or delivery within 2 business days from the date of the report. "Short-term" means maturing in 1 year or less from the date of the report.

"Majority-owned foreign partnerships" are those organized under the laws of a foreign country in which one or more nonbanking concerns or nonprofit institutions in the United States, directly or indirectly, own more than 50 percent profit interest. "Majority-owned foreign subsidiaries" are foreign corporations in which one or more nonbanking business concerns or nonprofit institutions located in the United States, directly or indirectly own stock with more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or more than 50 percent of the total value of all classes of stock.

Reporting Threshold

The exemption level applicable to banks and banking institutions is $10 million equivalent. The exemption level applicable to nonbanking business concerns and nonprofit institutions was $1 million equivalent on all nonbank forms from March 1975 through November 1976. It was raised to $2 million equivalent on the monthly reports of positions held in the United States from November 1976 through September 1978. The exemption level was raised to $3 million on foreign subsidiary positions on June 31, 1977, and for positions held in the United States on September 30, 1978.

Firms must report their entire foreign currency position in a specified foreign currency if a specified U.S. dollar equivalent value is reached in any category of assets, liabilities, exchange contracts bought and sold, or the net position in the currency. In general, exemption levels are applied to the entire firm in the United States and separately to each foreign branch or subsidiary. In reports on their foreign branches, majority-owned foreign partnerships and majority-owned foreign subsidiaries, U.S. banks and nonbanks are required to report the U.S. dollar-denominated assets, liabilities, exchange contracts bought and sold, and net positions of those branches, partnerships, and subsidiaries with reportable positions in the specified foreign currencies.

Description of Statistics

Data collected on the Treasury foreign currency forms are published in the Treasury Bulletin in seven sections. The first section presents a summary of worldwide net positions in all of the currencies reported. Sections II through VI each present data on a specified foreign currency. Section VII presents the U.S. dollar positions of the foreign branches and subsidiaries of U.S. firms which are required to report in one or more of the specified foreign currencies.

Department Circular No. 966, Revised, requires submission of semiannual financial statements by all Government corporations specifically subject to the Government Corporation Control Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. 846, 856), and any wholly owned and mixed-ownership corporations subsequently brought under the provisions of the act, and all other activities operating as revolving funds. Other business-type activities required to report semiannually include activities and agencies whose operations, services, or functions are largely self-liquidating or primarily of a revenue-producing nature or whose activities result in the accumulation of substantial inventories, investments, and other recoverable assets. Regular governmental activities, which are of a nonbusiness-type nature, are required to report on an annual basis.

Two basic kinds of financial statements are called for by Department

Circular No. 966, Revised; and they are published in the Treasury Bulletin. Statements of financial condition are required for all activities. Statements of income and retained earnings are required for business-type activities only.

The statements of financial condition for business-type activities appear in Section I, Table GA-I-1 and are published semiannually. The first statements of financial condition published under the revised circular were as of December 31, 1972, applied to business-type activities only, and appeared in the May 1973 issue of the Bulletin. Statements of financial condition submitted annually by nonbusiness-type activities were published together with business-type activities in Section I, Table GA-I-1 in the January 1974 issue of the Bulletin. Loans shown on the agencies' statements of financial condition and held by the agencies, and loans guaranteed and insured by the agencies are reported on a quarterly basis. The first quarterly table on this Federal credit data, which was as of March 31, 1973, appeared in Section III, Table GA-III-2 in the August 1973 issue of the Bulletin. The first semiannual statements of income and retained earnings submitted under the revised circular were for the period July 1, 1972, through December 31, 1972, and appeared in Section I, Table GA-I-2 in the June 1973 issue of the Bulletin. All revolving funds shown in the statements are noted to indicate whether they are public enterprise funds, intragovernmental funds, or trust revolving funds; and trust funds are also noted. Direct sales and repurchases of loans are published on a monthly basis in Section II, Table GA-II-1.
