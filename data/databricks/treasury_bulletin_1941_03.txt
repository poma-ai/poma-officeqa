Basis of Computation: Yields are computed on the basis of closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange. On days when an issue does not sell, the mean of bid and ask quotations is used for Treasury bonds, and the price of the last preceding sale is used for corporate bonds. Back Figures: (1) Long-term Treasury bonds: monthly, Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1939, p. 486; weekly, Treasury Bulletin, July 1939, p. 20, July 1940, p. 27, and subsequent issues; daily, mimeograph statement available from Treasury Department, Division of Research and Statistics. (2) High-grade corporate bonds: monthly and weekly, Treasury Bulletin, July 1939, p. 20, July 1940, p. 27, and subsequent issues. 
1/ Average of Treasury bonds not due or callable for twelve years. 
2/ Average of 5 bonds. 
3/ Average of daily figures. 
4/ Wednesday figures. 
5/ Reflects change in composition of Treasury bond average.

Note. For callable bonds, yields are computed to, and issues plotted as of, the earliest call date if the band is selling above par, and as of the final maturity date if the band is selling below par. The smooth curves are fitted by eye. Dollar amounts shown in descriptions of issues are in millions. Issues for which an exchange offer has been made and has expired are excluded. The yields on noncallable securities are not reflected by the curves.
