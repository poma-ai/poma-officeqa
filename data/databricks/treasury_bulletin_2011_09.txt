Profile of the Economy

[Source: Office of Macroeconomic Analysis] As of August 15, 2011

Introduction

Economic growth moderated during the first half of 2011, partly due to transitory factors, including poor weather early in the year, an unusually sharp drop in federal defense spending, a spike in energy prices, and automotive supply-chain disruptions stemming from the natural disaster in Japan. These factors have either reversed or are receding, and their absence is expected to provide a boost to growth in coming months. However, a more general slowing in underlying demand appears to have contributed to the softer-than-expected performance of the economy in recent months. Over the past 17 months, the economy has added a total of 1.9 million payroll jobs and the unemployment rate has trended broadly lower but is still high at 9.1 percent. Activity in the housing sector remains weak and continues to be restrained by excess supply, tight lending standards, and uncertainty about future home price values.

The run-up in oil and food prices earlier this year has impacted inflation as well as private consumption. Headline inflation has moved higher recently, but core inflation (which excludes food and energy) remains low by historical standards. In financial markets, equity indexes have turned lower very recently, and Treasury bond yields have declined substantially in recent weeks.

Financial disbursements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or the "Recovery Act") will be completed this year, but additional measures to restore financial stability and improve housing markets remain in place, including the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 (2010 Tax Relief Act). This Act, passed in December 2010, included a 2 percent payroll tax cut designed to help sustain the upward momentum of the recovery.

Pursuing its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve continues to bolster liquidity by maintaining holdings of securities at current levels and rolling over holdings of Treasury securities as they mature. At the end of June 2011, the Federal Reserve completed its purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. At its latest meeting in August, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) affirmed a continuation of the current federal funds rate target range through mid-2013, citing a weak economy and labor market.

Economic Growth

Since the current expansion began in mid-2009, the economy has grown by 5.0 percent. According to the advance estimate, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from a 0.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2011 to a 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter of

Growth of Real GDP

(Quarterly percent change at annual rate)

2011—the eighth straight quarter of growth since the economy emerged from recession in mid-2009. Growth in the second quarter was held down by automotive supply-chain disruptions which caused domestic motor vehicle output to fall and contributed to a pronounced drop in consumer spending. However, supply-chain problems are being resolved fairly rapidly, and automotive output is projected to rebound sharply in the third quarter, providing a boost to real GDP growth. Private consensus forecasts currently put third-quarter real GDP growth at a 3 percent annual rate.

Private domestic final demand (consumption plus private fixed investment, considered a better measure of underlying demand because it subtracts out inventory movements) grew by 0.9 percent in the second quarter, slowing from the first quarter's 2.0 percent rise. The deceleration reflected a marked slowdown in consumer spending.

Real personal consumption expenditures—which account for about 70 percent of GDP—edged up only 0.1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, after growing by 2.1 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. A large decline in motor vehicle purchases accounted for about half of the slowdown in consumer expenditures between the first and second quarters.

Residential investment—mostly residential homebuilding—rose 3.8 percent in the second quarter, after falling 2.4 percent in the first quarter. The pick-up in residential activity added 0.1 percentage point to real GDP growth. Housing activity continues to be weighed down by a number of factors, including uncertainty about future home price values and the high level of unemployment. New home building

and sales remain depressed. Single family housing starts rose 9.4 percent in June to 453,000 units (annualized), but this level was still 75 percent below the January 2006 peak. New single-family home sales fell 1.0 percent in June to 312,000 (annualized) but were still 77.5 percent below the July 2005 peak. Existing single-family home sales were unchanged in June at 4.2 million units (annualized), but were 33 percent below the September 2005 peak. The number of new single-family homes for sale is at its lowest level on record (back to 1963). Relative to sales, there was a 6.3-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of June. While the supply of new homes available for sale has returned to its long-run average, the inventory of existing single-family homes was still very high relative to sales at a 9.5 month supply in June. Home price measures continue to fall on a year-over-year basis. The Federal Housing Financing Authority (FHFA) purchase-only house price index increased 0.4 percent in May, but was down 6.3 percent in the year through May, compared with a 2.2 percent decline a year earlier. The Standard & Poor’s (S&P)/Case-Shiller composite home price indexes rose in May the 20-city index rose 1.0 percent and the 10-city index rose 1.1 percent. On a 12-month basis through May 2011, the 20-city index declined 4.5 percent while the 10-city index was 3.6 percent lower.

Nonresidential fixed investment—about 10 percent of GDP—advanced 6.3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2011, accelerating from an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter. For the past six quarters, nonresidential fixed investment growth has averaged nearly 9 percent. Growth in business spending on equipment and software moderated to a 5.7 percent pace in the second quarter, after rising 8.7 percent in the first quarter. However, after falling by 14.3 percent in the first quarter, outlays for structures jumped 8.1 percent. Altogether, nonresidential fixed investment contributed 0.6 percentage point to real GDP growth in the second quarter. Inventory accumulation boosted growth by an additional 0.2 percentage point.

Exports account for about 12 percent of GDP, while imports (which are subtracted from total domestic spending to calculate GDP) account for about 17 percent. In each of the 3 years prior to 2010, the net export deficit (exports less imports) narrowed, reflecting weak demand for imports that exceeded softer foreign demand for U.S. goods and services. The improvement in the net export deficit contributed 1 percentage point on average to quarterly real GDP growth during this period. In 2010, this trend reversed, and for the year as a whole, net exports posed a drag on growth of 0.5 percentage point. In the first quarter of this year, net exports were only a modest drag on growth of 0.3 percentage point, as exports grew nearly 8 percent and imports advanced by 8.3 percent. In the second quarter, export growth slowed to 6 percent, but import growth slowed substantially more to 1.3 percent. The result improvement in the trade deficit contributed 0.6 percentage point to second-quarter GDP growth.

The current account balance (reflecting international trade in goods and services, investment income flows, and unilateral transfers) has been in deficit almost continuously since the early 1980s, and in 2006, reached a record $803 billion, equivalent to 6.0 percent of GDP. By 2009, the current account deficit had narrowed to $377 billion (2.7 percent of GDP), as the trade deficit narrowed, but it widened in 2010 to $471 billion (3.2 percent of GDP) as the U.S. economy recovered. The current account deficit continued to grow in early 2011, rising to $477 billion at an annual rate, but remained roughly stable as a share of GDP at 3.2 percent.

Government purchases—which account for roughly 20 percent of GDP—fell 1.1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, subtracting 0.2 percentage point from real GDP growth. A 2.2 percent increase in federal spending was completely offset by a 3.4 percent decline in state and local government expenditures. (In the first quarter, government spending had plunged by 5.9 percent, pulled down by a 12.6 percent drop in Federal defense outlays.)

Labor Markets

During the recession (from December 2007 through June 2009), the economy lost 7.7 million private-sector jobs. The economy continued to lose jobs even after the recovery began, but in March 2010 nonfarm payrolls began to rise. Since then, total employment has grown by more than 1.9 million. In the private sector, employment has increased by almost 2.4 million during the same period.

Job losses during the recession were spread broadly across most sectors but with the resumption of job growth, many of these sectors have added jobs. Since the labor market recovery began in early 2010, payrolls in professional and business services have risen by 649,000, and leisure and hospitality industries' employment has increased by 293,000. Manufacturing payrolls have grown by 283,000 since early 2010. A few sectors continued to add jobs throughout the recession and are still hiring: since early 2010, the health care sector has added 491,000 jobs. On the other hand, the government sector, notably at the local level, has lost more jobs in recent months than during the 19 months of recession. Since early 2010, government payrolls have declined by 440,000, including 323,000 local government jobs.

The unemployment rate peaked at 10.1 percent in October 2009—a 26-year high and 5.7 percentage points above the March 2007 low of 4.4 percent. The unemployment rate has since declined, on trend, reaching 8.8 percent in March 2011 before climbing back up to 9.2 percent in June. As of July 2011, however, it had edged back down to 9.1 percent. A broader measure of unemployment that includes workers who are underemployed and those who are only marginally attached to the labor force reached a record high of 17.4 percent in October 2009 (series dates from 1994)—nearly double its level of 8.8 percent in December 2007. This measure stood at 16.1 percent in July

2011. The percentage of the unemployed who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more peaked at an all-time high of 45.6 percent in May 2010, then edged down in subsequent months before climbing again to reach 45.5 percent in March 2011. As of July 2011, it had edged down to 44.4 percent.

Inflation

Headline inflation has moved higher recently, reflecting sharp increases in food and energy prices, but core inflation (excluding food and energy) is still low by historical standards. Headline consumer prices rose 3.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, accelerating from the previous year's 1.1 percent increase. Energy prices rose 20.1 percent in the year through June, well above the year-earlier, 3.0 percent increase. On a 12-month basis core consumer prices (excluding food and energy) rose 1.6 percent through June 2011, compared with a 0.9 percent advance a year ago. Energy prices have fallen more recently, a trend expected to help reduce headline inflation in the future. Labor market slack and the continued low level of capacity utilization are expected to keep core inflation relatively low going forward. Energy prices rose sharply earlier this year, reflecting political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and concerns about supply disruptions. From mid February to late April, the front-month futures price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil increased by almost $30 (about 35 percent) to nearly $114 per barrel. Retail gasoline prices climbed in response, reaching a peak of $3.97 per gallon in May. Energy prices have since fallen, with the front-month

futures price of WTI averaging $87 per barrel in the first half of August. The retail price of regular gasoline was $3.67 per gallon in the week ended August 8, 2011, down 30 cents from its early May peak.

Food prices have risen noticeably in the past several months. In the year through June 2011, consumer food prices increased 3.7 percent, much faster than the 0.7 percent rise of the previous year.

Federal Budget

The federal budget deficit narrowed to $1.3 trillion (8.9 percent of GDP) in fiscal year 2010, from $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2009 (10.0 percent of GDP). The Administration's Fiscal Year 2012 Budget, which was released in February, projects the deficit will widen to 10.9 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2011, in part because of the December 2010 tax cut agreement, but then narrow significantly over subsequent years, as the economy recovers and provisions of the Recovery Act and the December 2010 tax legislation expire. By fiscal year 2013, the deficit is expected to fall by half to 4.6 percent of GDP. The forthcoming Mid-Session Review of the Budget will contain revised projections for the future path of the budget deficit.

The Budget Control Act signed into law on August 2 will reduce the budget deficit by nearly $1 trillion over 10 years, with savings split equally between cuts to defense and nondefense discretionary spending. The agreement also established a bipartisan committee process to identify an additional $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, including savings from entitlement and tax reform. The committee is required to report legislation by November 23, 2011, and Congress is required to vote on recommendations by December 23, 2011. If the committee fails to produce an agreement, an automatic sequestration process will reduce government spending by an additional $133 billion each year from 2013 to 2021, for a total savings of $1.2 trillion. Cuts will be split equally between defense and nondefense outlays; Social Security, Medicaid and low-income programs would be exempt.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, the deal will lower projected deficits by an average of 1.1 percent of GDP each year from 2013 to 2021 (assuming at least $2.1 trillion in deficit reduction). Between 2016 and 2021, the deficit will average 3.5 percent of GDP. The primary deficit will average 0.3 percent of GDP from 2016 to 2021, and will be eliminated in 2021. The Budget Control Act also authorized the President to increase the debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion, eliminating the need for further increases until 2013.

Economic Policy

Key fiscal and monetary policy actions taken over the past few years have aided the recovery. On the fiscal policy side, the ARRA authorized the Federal Government to spend $787 billion to stimulate domestic demand. As of late July, 2011, nearly $670 billion in funds had been paid out, and all disbursements will be completed later this year. This spending has provided an important boost to economic activity in recent years. The CBO estimates that payroll employment would have been 1.2 million to 3.3 million lower in the first quarter of 2011 without the Recovery Act.

Late in 2009, the first-time home buyer tax credit was temporarily extended and expanded to include all home buyers (it expired on April 30, 2010), and a new Small

Business Jobs and Wages Tax Credit was announced to help small businesses create jobs. In August 2010, the Government approved legislation providing an additional $26 billion for State and local Governments to support jobs and medical services. Finally, in December 2010, the 2010 Tax Relief Act authorized a 2 percent payroll tax cut, extensions of unemployment benefits, and extensions of refundable tax credits, and a two-year extension of the 2001 tax cuts.

Partly in response to rising financial market stress, as well as to signs of more slowing in the broader economy, the Federal Reserve began easing monetary policy in August 2007. By late 2008, the FOMC had lowered the federal funds target interest rate dramatically, reducing it to a historically low target range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent at the December 2008 FOMC meeting. That target range was maintained at the FOMC's most recent meeting in early August 2011. At the same time, the Committee acknowledged that "the pace of recovery has slowed and indicated that, "economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through 2013." Whereas the June FOMC accompanying statement noted that, "the Committee expected the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters," the August statement observed that, "downside risks to the economic outlook have increased." In addition to lowering the federal funds rate target, in late 2008, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its tools to increase liquidity in credit markets and eased lending terms to sectors in need of liquidity, including a variety of facilities and funds directed at specific financial markets. As of June 30, 2010, all of these special facilities had expired. At the August 2010 FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve announced it would maintain its holdings of securities at current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities and to continue rolling over the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities as they mature. At the end of June 2011, the FOMC completed purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities.

Financial Markets

Financial markets have largely recovered from the unprecedented strains experienced in the fall of 2008, but have recently come under renewed pressure as investors express concerns about slowing economic growth in the U.S. as well as globally. Credit flows have improved substantially since early 2009, although credit conditions in some markets remain relatively tight. Bank lending has been picking up, with stabilization or further easing of standards, terms, and loan demand, depending upon market segment. Measures of risk tolerance and volatility have recently deteriorated somewhat, also reflecting renewed concerns about economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad.

After plunging 38.5 percent in 2008, the sharpest loss since 1931 (when an earlier version of the index, containing

only 90 stocks, dropped 47 percent), the S&P 500 index rose 23.5 percent in 2009 and 12.8 percent in 2010. However, thus far in 2011, the S&P 500 is about 4 percent lower. The S&P Stock Market Volatility Index (VIX), often used as a measure of financial market uncertainty, surged to an all-time high of 80 percent in late October 2008, after hovering in a range of 20 to 30 percent for most of that year. The VIX retreated fairly steadily during 2009, ending that year at about 20 percent, but fluctuated more widely last year, resurging to a recent peak of nearly 46 percent in mid-May 2010. It declined relatively steadily thereafter, but more recently has moved higher, and in mid-August stood at 32 percent.

A variety of factors have buffeted long-term Treasury interest rates, including flight-to-quality flows in response to a variety of specific risk events as well as supply concerns related to funding of the government's debt and most recently, concern about the need for fiscal retrenchment and the downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by rating agency S&P in early August. The yield on the 10-year note reached a low of 2.1 percent in late December 2008, but then moved higher, closing in early April 2010 above the 4 percent mark for the first time since October 2008. For the remainder of last year, the yield fell, reaching a recent low of 2.41 percent in early October before resuming an upward climb to 3.75 percent as of February 2011. The yield on the 10-year note has trended lower since then, and in recent weeks has dropped precipitously, reaching 2.3 percent in mid-August (within 25 basis points of the December 2008 low). The 3-month Treasury bill yield, by contrast, generally trended lower throughout 2008 under the relatively steady influence of safe-haven demand for short-term liquid assets. The yield almost fell to zero—a record low—by the end of December

2008, then fluctuated in a range of 0.0 to 0.2 percent throughout 2009. Last year, the yield moved in a narrow range of 0.05 to 0.2 percent, fluctuating at the upper end of this range through late February 2011. Since then, the yield has fluctuated in a wider range, from 0.02 to 0.10 percent, and stood at 0.02 percent as of early August 2011. The 2- to 10-year Treasury yield spread, one measure of the steepness of the yield curve, widened (steepened) noticeably starting in mid-2007, when it was roughly 20 basis points, to 290 basis points in mid-January 2010, then narrowed during the rest of last year, reaching about 200 basis points last October. After that, the spread widened, reaching 291 basis points as of early February 2011 before narrowing again to 233 basis points as of early August 2011.

Key interest rates on private securities, which spiked in response to financial market turbulence in late 2008, have since retraced as conditions have stabilized. The spread between the 3-month London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the 3-month Treasury bill rate (the TED spread, a measure of inter-bank liquidity and credit risk) rose to an all-time high of nearly 460 basis points in early October 2008. However, improvements in short-term credit availability led to a narrowing of this spread to 9 basis points in March 2010. Through mid-June 2010, the spread widened again to nearly 50 basis points, then narrowed to a recent low of 12 basis points in late November 2010. As of early August, 2011, the spread was about 30 basis points. The spread between the Baa corporate bond yield and the 10-year Treasury yield peaked at nearly 620 basis points in December 2008. After narrowing in 2009 and early 2010, the spread widened again to a recent peak of 331 basis points in mid-November 2010. However, since late last year, the

spread has consistently remained below 300 basis points, falling to 233 basis points in early August 2011. This level is still very high by historical standards.

Rates for conforming mortgages have trended lower in recent years, as have rates for jumbo mortgages. The interest rate for a 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgage fell to a record low of 4.17 percent in early November 2010, then climbed to a recent high of nearly 5.2 percent in mid-February 2011. Since then, the rate has declined, reaching 4.3 percent as of early August 2011.

Foreign Exchange Rates

The value of the U.S. dollar compared with the currencies of seven major trading partners (the euro area countries, Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, and Switzerland) has depreciated significantly from

its peak in February 2002. For example, between February 2002 and July 2009, the exchange value of the dollar compared to an index of these currencies fell by about 19 percent over this timeframe. Over the past 2 years (July 2009 to July 2011), the dollar has depreciated by about 9 percent against this index. Over the longer timeframe, the dollar depreciated by nearly 30 percent against the yen and by almost 40 percent against the euro. Over the past 2 years, the dollar has depreciated by 16 percent against the yen and by about 1 percent against the euro. Against an index of currencies of 19 other important trading partners (including China, India, and Mexico), the dollar depreciated 2 percent over the longer timeframe, and has depreciated roughly 9 percent against this basket over the past 2 years.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usually takes the form of appropriations that allow obligations to be incurred and payments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have expired or would otherwise expire. These are counted as new budget authority in the fiscal year of the legislation in which the reappropriation act is included, regardless of when the amounts were originally appropriated or when they would otherwise lapse.

Obligations generally are liquidated by the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash—outlays. Obligations may also be liquidated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned-income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts. Total Government receipts are compared with total outlays in calculating the budget surplus or deficit.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipt accounts). The former normally can be used without an appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursements to appropriations. For accounting purposes, earned reimbursements are also known as revenues. These offsetting collections are netted against gross outlays in determining net outlays from such appropriations; and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental, and trust); offsetting collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into three categories: (1) proprietary receipts, or collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function; (2) intragovernmental transactions, or payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts. They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts; and (3) offsetting governmental receipts that include foreign cash contributions.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions—payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Offsetting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and outlays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf lands; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept set forth in the “Report of the President’s Commission on Budget Concepts” as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1969. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government’s fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them outside of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Postal Service.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit ordinarily are not subject to targets set by the Congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (2 United States Code 900-922)] included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused on both on- and off-budget receipts, outlays and deficit of the Government.

FEDERAL FISCAL OPERATIONS

Tables FF0-1, FF0-2, and FF0-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, estimates for 2 years, detail for 13 months, and fiscal year-to-date data. They provide a summary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal entities and disbursing officers, and daily reports from the FRBs. They also detail accounting transactions affecting receipts and outlays of the Government and off-budget Federal entities and their related effect on assets and liabilities of the Government. Data are derived from the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets, and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FF0-2 includes on- and off-budget receipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties, and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FFO-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FFO-4 summarizes on- and off-budget receipts by source and outlays by function as reported to each major fund group classification for the current fiscal year to date and prior fiscal year to date.

Table FF0-5 summarizes internal revenue receipts by states and by type of tax. Amounts reported are collections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), payments made with tax returns and subsequent payments made after tax returns are due or are filed (that is, payments with delinquent returns or on delinquent accounts).

Amounts are reported based on the primary filing address provided by each taxpayer or reporting entity. For multistate corporations, the address may reflect only the district where such a corporation reported its taxes from a principal office rather than other districts where income was earned or where individual income and Social Security taxes were withheld. In addition, an individual may reside in one district and work in another.

Table FFO-6 includes customs collection of duties, taxes, and fees by districts and ports.

Third-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 supplements fiscal data reported in the June issue of the “Treasury Bulletin.” At the time of that issue's release, not enough data were available to adequately analyze collections for the quarter.

Individual income taxes—Individual income tax receipts, net of refunds, were $339.3 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. This is an increase of $77.5 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Withheld receipts increased by $22.3 billion and non-withheld receipts increased by $43.7 billion during this period. Refunds decreased by $11.5 billion over the comparable fiscal year 2010 quarter. There was a decrease of $7.3 billion in accounting adjustments between individual income tax receipts and the Social Security and Medicare trust funds over the comparable quarter in fiscal year 2010.

Corporate income taxes—Net corporate income tax receipts were $79.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. This is an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the

prior year third quarter. The $0.2 billion change is comprised of a decrease of $7.6 billion in estimated and final payments, and a decrease of $7.9 billion in corporate refunds.

Employment taxes and contributions—Employment taxes and contributions receipts for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 were $206.9 billion, a decrease of $19.3 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Federal Disability Insurance, and Federal Hospital Insurance trust funds changed by -$19.3 billion, -$3.3 billion, and $3.2 billion respectively. There was a -$1.1 billion accounting adjustment for prior years’ employment tax liabilities made in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, while there was a -$8.4 billion adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.

Unemployment insurance—Unemployment insurance receipts, net of refunds, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 were $28.7 billion, an increase of $4.5 billion over the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net State taxes deposited in the U.S. Treasury increased by $4.3 billion to $24.9 billion. Net Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes increased by $0.1 billion to $3.8 billion.

Contributions for other insurance and retirement—Contributions for other retirement were $1.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. This was a negligible change from the comparable quarter of fiscal year 2010.

Excise taxes—Net excise tax receipts for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 were $18.1 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Total excise tax refunds for the quarter were $1.1 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Estate and gift taxes—Net estate and gift tax receipts were $6.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. These

receipts represent an increase of $0.9 billion over the same quarter in fiscal year 2010.

Customs duties—Customs duties net of refunds were $7.1 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. This is an increase of $1.0 billion over the comparable prior year quarter.

Miscellaneous receipts—Net miscellaneous receipts for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 were $27.2 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. This change is due in part to deposits of earnings by Federal Reserve banks increasing by $6.0 billion.

INTRODUCTION: Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury’s) operating cash is maintained in accounts with the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs) and branches, as well as in tax and loan accounts in other financial institutions. Major information sources include FRBs, Treasury Regional Financial Centers, Internal Revenue Service Centers, Bureau of the Public Debt, and various electronic systems. As the FRB accounts are depleted, funds are called in (withdrawn) from thousands of tax and loan accounts at financial institutions throughout the country.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147 (codified at 31 United States Code 323), Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositaries maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan (TT&L) investment program, depositary financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate. Financial institutions wishing to retain funds deposited into their tax

and loan accounts in interest-bearing obligations can participate. The program permits Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in TT&L depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way, Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuating operations on TT&L financial institution reserves and on the economy. Likewise, those institutions wishing to remit the funds to the Treasury account at FRBs do so as collector depositaries.

Deposits to tax and loan accounts occur as customers of financial institutions deposit tax payments that the financial institutions use to purchase Government securities. In most cases, this involves a transfer of funds from a customer's account to the tax and loan account in the same financial institution. Also, Treasury can direct the FRBs to invest excess funds in tax and loan accounts directly from the Treasury account at the FRBs.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities issued by other Federal agencies accounting for the rest. Tables in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" reflect the total. Further detailed information is published in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Likewise, information on agency securities and on investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government."

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" tables FD-2 and FD-6 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States."

Table FD-1 summarizes the Federal debt by listing public debt and agency securities held by the public, including the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agencies, largely by the Social Security and other Federal retirement trust funds. The net unamortized premium and discount also are listed by total Federal securities, securities held by Government accounts and securities held by the public. The difference between the outstanding face value of the Federal debt and the net unamortized premium and discount is classified as the accrual amount. (For greater detail on holdings of Federal securities by particular classes of investors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type, that is, marketable and nonmarketable, the total public debt securities outstanding that are held by the public.

In table FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by issues to particular funds within Government. Many of the funds invest in par value special series nonmarketables at interest rates determined by law. Others invest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents interest-bearing securities issued by Government agencies. Federal agency borrowing

has declined in recent years, in part because the Federal Financing Bank has provided financing to other Federal agencies. (Federal agency borrowing from Treasury is presented in the “Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government.”)

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt.

In March 1971, Congress enacted a limited exception to the amount of bonds with rates greater than 4-1/4 percent that could be held by the public. This permitted Treasury to offer securities maturing in more than 7 years at current market interest rates for the first time since 1965. In March 1976, the definition of a bond was changed to include those securities longer than 10 years to maturity. This exception has expanded since 1971, authorizing Treasury to continue to issue long-term securities. The ceiling on Treasury bonds was repealed on November 10, 1988.

The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the FRBs.

In table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Public Debt Operations

Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment, and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each outstanding marketable security is listed in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." The information in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" pertains only to marketable Treasury securities.

Table PDO-1 presents the results of weekly auctions of 4-, 13-, and 26-week bills. Treasury bills mature each Thursday. Issues of 4- and 13-week bills are reopenings of 26-week bills. High yields on accepted tenders and the dollar value of total bids are presented, with the dollar value of awards made on both competitive and noncompetitive bases.

To encourage the participation of individuals and smaller institutions, Treasury accepts noncompetitive tenders of up to $5 million for bills and $5 million for notes and bonds in each auction of securities.

Table PDO-2 lists the results of auctions of marketable securities, other than weekly bills, in chronological order over the past 2 years. Issues of cash management bills also are presented.

Note: Cash management bills identified below are issued as part of the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP). For more details about the SFP, visit www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1144.htm or call 202-622-2960.

Note: On February 4, 2009, Treasury announced the reintroduction of the 7-year note. The first auction of this security took place on February 26, 2009.

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, notes, and bonds that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. [See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.]

Effective January 1, 2001, Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt revised formats, titles, and column headings in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States," Table I: Summary of Treasury Securities Outstanding and Table II: Statutory Debt Limit. These changes should reduce confusion and bring the publication more in line with the public's use of terms.

Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) compiles data in the "Treasury Bulletin" table OFS-1 from the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Effective June 2001, FMS revised procedures and categories in this table to agree with the Bureau of the Public Debt's publication changes.

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and nonmarketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the FRBs, and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The FRBs acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated ownership of U.S. Treasury securities. Information is primarily obtained from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Flow of Funds data, Table L209. State, local, and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and foreign official accounts. They also include municipal, foreign official, and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes to the table for description of investor categories.)

INTRODUCTION: U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation

The U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation (USCC) statement informs the public of the total face value of currency and coin used as a medium of exchange that is in circulation at the end of a given accounting month. The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion deemed to be in circulation. It includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate or that may do so to a limited extent. Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various issues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census. USCC information has been published by Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when it was incorporated into the "Treasury Bulletin." The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve banks (FRBs), and the Federal Reserve Board.

1 Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) adopted a technique for valuing the special drawing right (SDR) based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and reserve position in the IMF also are valued on this basis beginning July 1974.

2 Treasury values its gold stock at $42.2222 per fine troy ounce and pursuant to 31 United States Code 5117 (b) issues gold certificates to the Federal Reserve at the same rate against all gold held.

3 Includes allocations of SDRs in the Special Drawing Account in the IMF, plus or minus transactions in SDRs. Recent allocations are as follows: August 2009—$43,069 million and September 2009—$4,529 million.

4 Includes holdings of Treasury and Federal Reserve System; beginning November 1978, these are valued at current market exchange rates or, where appropriate, at such other rates as may be agreed upon by the parties to the transactions. Excludes outstanding reciprocal currency swaps with foreign central banks. As of end-July 2011, there were no swaps outstanding.

The United States has the right to purchase foreign currencies equivalent to its reserve position in the IMF automatically if needed. Under appropriate conditions, the United States could purchase additional amounts related to the U.S. quota.

Background

Data relating to U.S. international transactions in financial instruments and to other portfolio capital movements between the United States and foreign countries have been collected in some form since 1935. This information is necessary for compiling the U.S. balance of payments accounts, for calculating the U.S. international investment position, and for use in formulating U.S. international financial and monetary policies.

From the beginning, reporting under the Treasury data collection program has been mandatory. Under the current Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system, an assortment of monthly and quarterly reports are filed with district Federal Reserve banks by commercial banks, securities dealers, other financial institutions, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States. These data are centrally processed and maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which, along with the district banks, acts as fiscal agent for Treasury. Beginning in late 1998, the Federal Reserve Board also undertakes services on behalf of Treasury in support of the TIC data collection system. The TIC reports of individual respondents are treated as confidential, and access to the respondent level data is strictly limited to specific staff of Treasury and the Federal Reserve System.

Data derived from Treasury reports are published in the Capital Movements section of this quarterly Treasury Bulletin and are posted monthly on the TIC website, http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. (See NOTE at the end of the INTRODUCTION text for additional website information.) TIC data aggregates are also published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and are used in the U.S. international transactions and investment position compilations published by the Department of Commerce in the Survey of Current Business.

Forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultation with representatives of banks, securities firms, and nonbanking enterprises. Requests for public comments on proposed changes are published in the Federal Register, and any further modifications are based on the comments received. The most recent revisions to selected reporting forms and instructions were effective June 30, 2006. The reporting forms and instructions may be downloaded from the TIC website. Copies of the reporting forms and instructions also may be obtained from the Global Economics Group, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220; the International Finance Division, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551; or district Federal Reserve banks.

INTRODUCTION: Capital Movements

Basic definitions

The term "foreigner" as used in TIC reporting covers all institutions and individuals resident outside the United States, including: U.S. citizens domiciled abroad; the foreign branches, subsidiaries and offices of U.S. banks and business concerns; the central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of foreign countries, wherever located; and international and regional organizations, wherever located. The term "foreigner" also includes persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting on behalf of foreigners.

In general, information is reported opposite the country or geographical area where the foreigner is located, as shown on records of reporting institutions. This information may not always reflect the ultimate ownership of assets. Reporting institutions are not required to go beyond addresses shown on their records and may not be aware of the actual country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary.

Transactions with branches or agencies of foreign official institutions, wherever located, are reported opposite the country that has sovereignty over the institutions. Transactions with international and regional organizations are not reported opposite any single country, but are accounted for in regional groupings of such organizations. Effective beginning with data for June 2006, information pertaining to the Bank for International Settlements is now included with data for international organizations, and information for the European Central Bank is distributed across the individual euro-area countries. For prior dates, information for these organizations is included in "Other Europe."

"Short-term" refers to obligations payable on demand or having an original maturity of one year or less. "Long-term" refers to obligations having an original maturity of more than one year and includes securities having no maturity.

Reporting coverage

TIC reports are required from banks and other depository institutions, bank/financial holding companies (BHCs/FHCs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking concerns in the United States, including the branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and other affiliates in the United States of foreign banking and nonbanking firms. Institutions with total reportable liabilities, claims, or securities transactions below specified reporting thresholds are exempt from reporting.

Beginning in February 2003, substantial revisions to the coverage and formats of the TIC B-series and C-series forms were introduced. The reasons for the changes were to comply with new and expanded international standards for reporting data on portfolio investment; to reduce reporting burden; to clarify reporting concepts and instructions; and to improve the quality of the series by closing known gaps in the data.

Banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers file monthly B-series reports covering their dollar liabilities to and dollar claims on foreigners in a number of countries. Quarterly reports are filed for liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies and for claims on foreigners held for respondents' domestic customers. All positions are exclusive of long-term securities. Beginning January 2001, the exemption level applicable to the banking reports was raised from $15 million to $50 million. This exemption level is also subject to the provision that reportable amounts for any one country do not exceed $25 million.

Banks and other depository institutions, securities brokers and dealers, and other entities report their transactions with foreigners by country in long-term securities on monthly Form S. Respondents must report securities transactions with foreigners if their aggregate purchases or their aggregate sales amount to at least $50 million during the covered month.

TIC Form D is filed quarterly by all U.S. resident banks, securities dealers, and other firms with worldwide holding of derivatives in their own and in their customers' accounts exceeding $100 billion in notional value. Data from this information collection was first released on May 15, 2007, with data on holdings beginning from end-December 2005, and data on net settlements beginning from the first quarter of 2006.

Quarterly reports are also filed by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions, and securities firms), and other nonbanking enterprises on their liabilities and claims positions with unaffiliated foreigners. Separate reports are filed for financial balances and for commercial balances. Effective for reports filed as of March 31, 2003, the threshold applicable to Form CQ-1 for reporting financial liabilities to, and claims on, foreigners is $50 million, up from $10 million. At the same time, the reporting threshold for Form CQ-2, which covers commercial liabilities and claims positions with foreigners, was raised from $10 million to $25 million.

Effective with the reports filed for June 2006, the country coverage of the monthly TIC forms was expanded significantly and the semiannual reports, which covered the smaller market economies, were discontinued. Country coverage was also expanded for the quarterly banking forms, the Form S, the Form D, and the Forms CQ-1 and CQ-2, effective with reports filed for June 2006.

The data in these tables do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and other countries. Except as noted in Section IV in "Description of statistics" below, the principal exclusions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies (own foreign offices) and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international

capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce in its regular reports on the U.S. balance of payments.

Effective with the December 2009 Treasury Bulletin, a number of data reporters were reclassified in the TIC system as bank holding companies, beginning with the reports as of the fourth quarter of 2008. These data reporters are now included in the monthly bank-reported statistics and are no longer reporting as nonbanks.

Description of statistics

Data collected on the TIC forms are published in the “Capital Movements” tables in four sections. Each section contains all the data relevant to the same statistical series, with tables showing time series by type and country, and detailed breakdowns of the latest available data. The expansion of the country coverage on the standard report forms allows for publication of additional country detail for data beginning as of June 2006. As a result, the former Capital Movements Section III, which listed bank-reported claims and liabilities of selected countries from the semiannual reports, has been discontinued.

Section I covers liabilities to foreigners reported by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. BHCs/FHCs also report for all domestic nonbank, non-securities firm affiliates, other than their insurance affiliates, which report separately on the C-series forms. Dollar-denominated liabilities are reported monthly on Forms BL-1 and BL-2. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported quarterly on Form BQ-2. Respondents report certain of their own liabilities and a wide range of their custody liabilities to foreigners. Effective with reports filed as of February 28, 2003, coverage was broadened to cover the positions of U.S. broker-dealer respondents with their affiliated foreign offices. (Depository institutions and BHCs/FHCs already reported such positions.) The scope of the reports was also extended to include cross-border brokerage balances as well as offshore sweep accounts and loans to U.S. residents in “managed” foreign offices of U.S. reporting institutions. Additionally, in a new Part 2, Form BQ-2 was expanded to include the foreign currency-denominated liabilities held by respondents for their domestic customers. Further, banks' own positions have been defined to be consistent with regulatory reports such as the FR 2950/2951 to include all amounts in the respondent's “due to/due from” accounts, unless in an instrument that is specifically excluded. Finally, the columns for demand deposits and non-transactions accounts are now combined, as are short-term U.S. agency securities and other negotiable and readily transferable instruments.

Section II presents claims on foreigners reported by banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers in the United States. BHCs/FHCs also report for their domestic nonbank and non-securities firm affiliates, other than their insurance affiliates, which report

separately on the C-series forms. Data on respondents' own dollar claims are collected monthly on Form BC Information on claims held for domestic customers as well as on claims denominated in foreign currencies is collected on a quarterly basis only on Forms BQ-1 and BQ-2, respectively. Effective with reports filed as of February 28, 2003, reporting coverage was expanded as outlined in Section I. Additionally, columns were added for separate reporting of negotiable CDs and other short-term negotiable instruments issued by foreigners. Further, the foreigner category, "foreign official institutions," replaced the former, broader category, "foreign public borrowers," for consistency with the liabilities reporting on this sector.

Section III (formerly reported as Section IV) shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners of exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions, and securities brokers and dealers), and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Data exclude claims on foreigners held by banks in the United States.

Historically, the TIC reports CQ-1 and CQ-2 exclude accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. Such accounts with foreign affiliates are reported by business enterprises to Commerce on its direct investment forms. There was an exception when reporting of foreign affiliate positions of insurance underwriting subsidiaries and financial intermediaries was included in Section B of Form CQ-1 for reports between end-March 2003 and end-March 2006. That reporting requirement was discontinued with the reports beginning as of June 2006.

Section IV (formerly Section V) contains information on transactions with foreigners in long-term domestic and foreign securities as reported by banks, securities brokers and dealers, and other entities in the United States. The data cover transactions executed in the United States for the accounts of foreigners and transactions executed abroad for the accounts of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. This includes transactions in newly-issued securities as well as transactions in, and redemptions of, outstanding issues. However, the data do not include nonmarketable Treasury bonds and notes shown in Table IFS-3.

The geographical allocation of the transactions data indicates the country of location of the foreign buyers and sellers who deal directly with reporting institutions in the United States. The data do not necessarily indicate the country of beneficial owner or issuer, or the currency of denomination of securities. For instance, a U.S. purchaser's order for Japanese securities may be placed directly with an intermediary in London. In this instance, the transaction for Form S reporting purposes would be recorded opposite the United Kingdom and not opposite Japan. Similarly,

purchases and sales of U.S. securities for the account of an Italian resident may be placed, for example, in the Swiss market. In that case, the trades would be reported opposite Switzerland and not opposite Italy.

Section V presents quarterly data on holdings and net cash settlements of cross-border derivatives contracts reported by banks, securities brokers, dealers, and nonfinancial companies in the U.S. with sizable holdings of derivatives contracts. Total holdings are divided between those contracts with positive fair values and those contracts with negative fair values from the perspective of the reporter. The fair (market) value is generally defined as the amount for which a derivative contract could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The data on U.S. net settlements with foreign residents include all cash receipts and payments made during the quarter for the acquisition, sale, or final closeout of derivatives, including all settlement payments under the terms of derivatives contracts such as the periodic settlement under a swap agreement and the daily settlement of an exchange-traded contract. In calculating net settlements, U.S. receipts of cash from foreign persons are positive amounts (+), and U.S. payments of cash to foreign persons are negative amounts (-). Items excluded from net settlements are: (a) collateral including initial and maintenance margins, whether or not in the form of cash; and (b) purchases of underlying commodities, securities, or other noncash assets. (e.g., the purchase/sale by foreigners of a long-term security is reported on TIC Form S).

The gross fair (market) values and net settlement payments on derivatives are reported by type of derivative and by country based on the residence of the direct foreign counterparty. Positions of foreign customers on U.S. exchanges are reported opposite the country in which the foreign counterparty resides. In the case of U.S. residents' futures contracts on foreign exchanges, the country of the exchange is reported as the country of the foreign counterparty.

NOTE: Current and historical data on United States transactions with foreigners in long-term securities on the gross foreign liabilities and claims reported by banks and nonbanks in the United States and on derivatives contracts with foreigners are available on the TIC website: http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. These data may be downloaded as separate time series for each country or geographical area regularly shown in the capital movements tables. Also available on this website are other series, including a table on “Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities,” showing estimated total holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes for current and recent periods. All data series on the TIC website are updated monthly.

CHART CM-A.—U.S. Liabilities to Foreigners Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers, and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

U.S. liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks were recorded at $4.8 trillion in June 2011, an increase of $132 billion from yearend 2010. U.S. banking liabilities include foreign holdings of U.S. short-term securities but exclude foreign holdings of U.S. long-term securities. U.S. banking liabilities decreased about $427 billion in 2009 but increased about $200 billion in 2008 and about $142 billion in 2010. However, the 2008 increase is primarily attributable to the addition of several new bank holding companies to the reporter panel.

U.S. banking liabilities are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that over 60 percent of U.S. banking liabilities is currently recorded against the United Kingdom and banking centers in the Caribbean. These financial centers recorded most of the decline in banking liabilities in 2008 and 2009. However, the crisis affected other regions as well, including all other Europe and Asia (including Japan), all of which experienced a decline in banking liabilities against the United States in 2009 and 2010. In contrast, during the first half of 2011 U.S. liabilities to foreigners grew for most regions. The Caribbean was the exception, with U.S. liabilities falling slightly over those recorded in 2010.

In March 2011, U.S. claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks amounted to about $4.6 trillion, an increase of $106 billion from that recorded at yearend 2010. U.S. banking claims include holdings of foreign short-term securities but exclude holdings of foreign long-term securities. U.S. banking claims increased $247 billion in 2009 and $565 billion in 2010. However, they decreased $95 billion during the global financial crisis in 2008, despite an increase from the addition of several new bank holding companies to the reporter panel.

As with U.S. banking liabilities, U.S. banking claims on foreigners are concentrated in international financial centers. Nearly 65 percent of these claims are reported opposite the United Kingdom and banking centers in the Caribbean. These financial centers accounted for much of the decline in U.S. banking claims in 2008. U.S. banking claims on most regions recovered during 2009 and 2010 and remained strong throughout the first quarter of 2011; however, claims fell slightly for the Caribbean and Japan. The share of U.S. claims accounted for by “All other countries” which includes Australia and Canada as well as countries in Latin America, has increased steadily over the past 4 years.

CHART CM-C.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Domestic Securities by Foreigners, Selected Countries

The data on this page represent foreign investors' purchases and sales of long-term U.S. securities (that is, U.S. Treasury and Government agency bonds and notes, and U.S. corporate bonds and stocks) as reported in the TIC reporting system. Foreign investors have also acquired U.S. equities through mergers and reincorporations that involve stock swaps, but these acquisitions have been relatively small in recent years, with no acquisitions in 2008, and acquisitions of less than $1 billion in 2009. Stock swap acquisitions picked up to over $8 billion in 2010, but this pace of acquisition again declined during the first half of 2011 to less than $1 billion. (Stock swaps data for the most recent quarter are Federal Reserve Board/Treasury estimates and are subject to substantial revisions.) These stock swaps are not reported under the TIC reporting system, but are available on the TIC Website. The TIC Website also provides estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on principal repayment flows of foreign holdings of U.S. government agency and corporate asset-backed securities (ABS). These repayments are estimated to have reduced foreign net purchases of U.S. securities by $191 billion in 2008, $204 billion in 2009, $232 billion in the 2010, and $82 billion in the first half of 2011.

After including stock swaps and accounting for ABS repayment flows, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities totaled $224 billion in 2008 as foreign investors acquired U.S. securities in the first half of the year, but on net sold U.S. securities in the second half of the year. Foreign net purchases recovered to $436 billion in 2009. The pace of acquisition picked up further in 2010, when foreign net purchases were recorded at $687 billion, surpassing those in 2008 and 2009 and nearly recovering the momentum recorded in 2007. The pace of acquisition has slowed so far in 2011, with acquisitions in the first half of the year recorded at only $158 billion.

CHART CM-D.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Foreign Securities by U.S. Investors*

The data on this page represent U.S. investors' purchases and sales of long-term foreign securities as reported to the TIC reporting system. U.S. investors also have acquired foreign stocks through mergers that involve stock swaps. Net acquisitions through stock swaps amounted to $12 billion in 2007, $7 billion in 2008, $2 billion in 2009, $12 billion in 2010, and $6 billion during the first half of 2011. (Stock swaps data for the most recent quarter are Federal Reserve Board/Treasury estimates and are subject to substantial revisions.) These stock swaps are not reported under the TIC reporting system, but are available on the TIC Website.

Including acquisitions through stock swaps, U.S. net purchases of long-term foreign securities amounted to $241 billion in 2007. U.S. investors switched to net sales of $67 billion in foreign securities in 2008 but resumed their net purchases of foreign securities in 2009 with acquisitions of $189 billion. Net purchases slowed in 2010 to $140 billion but have picked up slightly during the first half of 2011 to $80 billion.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

The “Treasury Bulletin” reports foreign currency holdings of large foreign exchange market participants. These reports provide information on positions in derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange futures and options that are increasingly used in establishing foreign exchange positions but were not covered in the old reports.

The information is based on reports of large foreign exchange market participants on holdings of five major foreign currencies (Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound sterling, and euro) and the U.S. dollar. Positions in the U.S. dollar, which have been collected since January 1999, are intended to approximate "all other" currency positions of reporting institutions. U.S.-based businesses file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, branches, and agencies. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Filing is required by law (31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Regulations 128, Subpart C).

Weekly and monthly reports must be filed throughout the calendar year by major foreign exchange market participants, which are defined as market participants with more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (end March, June, September, or December). Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold.

A quarterly report must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange market participant that had more than $5 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any quarter the previous year (end March, June, September, or December).

This information is published in six sections corresponding to each of the major currencies covered by the reports. Tables I-1 through VI-1 present the currency data reported weekly by major market participants. Tables I-2 through VI-2 present more detailed currency data of major market participants, based on monthly reports. Tables I-3 through VI-3 present quarterly consolidated currency data reported by large market participants that do not file weekly reports. The information in the tables referenced above is based on the reports referenced in this Introduction: Foreign Currency Positions and is not audited by the Federal Reserve banks or the Treasury Department.

Principal exchanged under cross-currency interest rate swaps is reported as part of purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Such principal also was noted separately on monthly and quarterly reports through December 1998, when this practice was discontinued. The net options position, or the net delta-equivalent value of an options position, is an estimate of the relationship between an option's value and an equivalent currency hedge. The delta equivalent value is defined as the product of the first partial derivative of an option valuation formula (with respect to the price of the underlying currency) multiplied by the notional principal of the contract.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established pursuant to chapter 6, section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (codified at 31 United States Code 5302), which authorized establishment of a Treasury fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose somewhat to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Resources of the fund include dollar balances, partially invested in U.S. Government securities, special drawing rights (SDRs), and balances of foreign currencies. Principal sources of income (+) or loss (-) for the fund are profits (+) or losses (-) on SDRs and foreign exchange, as well as interest earned on assets.

Table ESF-1 presents the assets, liabilities, and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents based on current exchange rates computed according to the accrual method of accounting. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the International Monetary Fund. Gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income (+) or loss (-) account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations by quarter. Figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents computed according to the accrual method. “Profit (+) or loss (-) on foreign exchange” includes realized profits or losses. “Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations” reflects net gain or loss on revaluation of SDR holdings and allocations for the quarter.

1 Beginning July 1974, the International Monetary Fund adopted a technique for valuing the SDRs based on a weighted average of exchange rates for the currencies of selected member countries. The U.S. SDR holdings and allocations are valued on this basis beginning July 1974.

Note. — Annual balance sheets for fiscal years 1934 through 1940 appeared in the 1940 "Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury" and those for succeeding years appeared in subsequent reports through 1980. Quarterly balance sheets beginning with December 31, 1938, have been published in the "Treasury Bulletin." Data from inception to September 30, 1978, may be found on the statements published in the January 1979 "Treasury Bulletin."

Glossary With References to Applicable Sections and Tables

Source: Financial Management Service

Amounts outstanding and in circulation (USCC)—Includes all issues by the Bureau of the Mint purposely intended as a medium of exchange. Coins sold by the Bureau of the Mint at premium prices are excluded; however, uncirculated coin sets sold at face value plus handling charge are included.

Average discount rate (PDO-1, -2)—In Treasury bill auctions purchasers tender competitive bids on a discount rate basis. The average discount rate is the weighted, or adjusted, average of all bids accepted in the auction.

Budget authority (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Congress passes laws giving budget authority to Government entities, which gives the agencies the power to spend Federal funds. Congress can stipulate various criteria for the spending of these funds. For example, Congress can stipulate that a given agency must spend within a specific year, number of years, or any time in the future.

The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, authority to borrow, contract authority, and authority to obligate and expend offsetting receipts and collections. The period of time during which Congress makes funds available may be specified as 1-year, multiple-year, or no-year. The available amount may be classified as either definite or indefinite; a specific amount or an unspecified amount can be made available. Authority also may be classified as current or permanent. Permanent authority requires no current action by Congress.

Budget deficit—The total, cumulative amount by which budget outlays (spending) exceed budget receipts (income).

Cash management bills (PDO-1)—Marketable Treasury bills of irregular maturity lengths, sold periodically to fund short-term cash needs of Treasury. Their sale, having higher minimum and multiple purchase requirements than those of other issues, is generally restricted to competitive bidders.

Competitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—A bid to purchase a stated amount of one issue of Treasury securities at a specified yield or discount. The bid is accepted if it is within the range accepted in the auction. (See Noncompetitive tenders.)

Currency no longer issued (USCC)—Old and new series gold and silver certificates, Federal Reserve notes, national bank notes, and 1890 Series Treasury notes.

Debt outstanding subject to limitation (FD-6)—The debt incurred by the Treasury subject to the statutory limit set by Congress. Until World War I, a specific amount of debt was authorized to each separate security issue. Beginning with the

Second Liberty Loan Act of 1917, the nature of the limitation was modified until, in 1941, it developed into an overall limit on the outstanding Federal debt. As of June 2011, the debt limit was $14,294,000 million; the limit may change from year to year.

The debt subject to limitation includes most of Treasury's public debt except securities issued to the Federal Financing Bank, upon which there is a limitation of $15 billion, and certain categories of older debt (totaling approximately $595 million as of February 1991).

Discount—The interest deducted in advance when purchasing notes or bonds. (See Accrued discount.)

Discount rate (PDO-1)—The difference between par value and the actual purchase price paid, annualized over a 360-day year. Because this rate is less than the actual yield (coupon-equivalent rate), the yield should be used in any comparison with coupon issue securities.

Dollar coins (USCC)—Include standard silver and nonsilver coins.

Domestic series (FD-2)—Nonmarketable, interest- and non-interest-bearing securities issued periodically by Treasury to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RFC) for investment of funds authorized under section 21B of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 United States Code 1441b).

Federal intrafund transactions (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Intrabudgetary transactions in which payments and receipts both occur within the same Federal fund group (Federal funds or trust funds).

Federal Reserve notes (USCC)—Issues by the U.S. Government to the public through the Federal Reserve banks and their member banks. They represent money owed by the Government to the public. Currently, the item “Federal Reserve notes—amounts outstanding” consists of new series issues. The Federal Reserve note is the only class of currency currently issued.

Foreign ("Foreign Currency Positions," IFS-2, -3)—Locations other than those included under the definition of the United States. (See United States.)

Foreigner ("Capital Movements," IFS-2)—All institutions and individuals living outside the United States, including U.S. citizens living abroad, and branches, subsidiaries, and other affiliates abroad of U.S. banks and business concerns; central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of countries other than the United States; and

September 2011

international and regional organizations, wherever located. Also refers to persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting for foreigners.

Foreign official institutions ("Capital Movements")—Includes central governments of foreign countries, including all departments and agencies of national governments; central banks, exchange authorities, and all fiscal agents of foreign national governments that undertake activities similar to those of a treasury, central bank, or stabilization fund; diplomatic and consular establishments of foreign national governments; and any international or regional organization, including subordinate and affiliate agencies, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states.

Foreign public borrower ("Capital Movements")—Includes foreign official institutions, as defined above, the corporations and agencies of foreign central governments, including development banks and institutions, and other agencies that are majority-owned by the central government or its departments; and state provincial and local governments of foreign countries and their departments and agencies.

Foreign-targeted issue (PDO-2)—Foreign-targeted issues were notes sold between October 1984 and February 1986 to foreign institutions, foreign branches of U.S. institutions, foreign central banks or monetary authorities, or to international organizations in which the United States held membership. Sold as companion issues, they could be converted to domestic (normal) Treasury notes with the same maturity and interest rates. Interest was paid annually.

Fractional coins (USCC)—Coins minted in denominations of 50, 25, and 10 cents, and minor coins (5 cents and 1 cent).

Government account series (FD-2)—Certain trust fund statutes require the Secretary of the Treasury to apply monies held by these funds toward the issuance of nonmarketable special securities. These securities are sold directly by Treasury to a specific Government agency, trust fund, or account. Their rate is based on an average of market yields on outstanding Treasury obligations, and they may be redeemed at the option of the holder. Roughly 80 percent of these are issued to five holders: the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund; the civil service retirement and disability fund; the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; the military retirement fund; and the Unemployment Trust Fund.

Interfund transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Transactions in which payments are made from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in another group.

International Monetary Fund ("Exchange Stabilization Fund," IFS-1)—(IMF) Established by the United Nations, the IMF promotes international trade, stability of exchange, and monetary cooperation. Members are allowed to draw from the fund.

Intrabudgetary transactions ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—These occur when payment and receipt both occur within the budget, or when payment is made from off-budget Federal entities whose budget authority and outlays are excluded from the budget totals.

Noncompetitive tenders ("Treasury Financing Operations")—This is a tender or bid to purchase a stated par amount of securities at the highest yield or discount rate awarded to competitive bidders for a single-price auction.

Obligations (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—An unpaid commitment to acquire goods or services.

Off-budget Federal entities (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)— Federally owned and controlled entities whose transactions are excluded from the budget totals under provisions of law. Their receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit are not included in budget receipts, outlays, or deficits. Their budget authority is not included in totals of the budget.

Outlays ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Payments on obligations in the form of cash, checks, the issuance of bonds or notes, or the maturing of interest coupons.

Own foreign offices ("Capital Movements")—Refers to U.S. reporting institutions' parent organizations, branches and/or majority-owned subsidiaries located outside the United States.

Par value—The face value of bonds or notes, including interest.

Quarterly financing (“Treasury Financing Operations”)—Treasury has historically offered packages of several “coupon” security issues on the 15th of February, May, August, and November, or on the next working day. These issues currently consist of a 3-year note, a 10-year note, and a 30-year bond. Treasury sometimes offers additional amounts of outstanding long-term notes or bonds, rather than selling new security issues. (See Reopening.)

Receipts (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—Funds collected from selling land, capital, or services, as well as collections from the public (budget receipts), such as taxes, fines, duties, and fees.

Reopening (PDO-2)—The offer for sale of additional amounts of outstanding issues, rather than an entirely new issue. A reopened issue will always have the same maturity date, CUSIP-number, and interest rate as the original issue.

Special drawing rights ("Exchange Stabilization Fund," IFS-1)—International assets created by IMF that serve to increase international liquidity and provide additional international reserves. SDRs may be purchased and sold among eligible holders through IMF. (See IMF.)

SDR allocations are the counterpart to SDRs issued by IMF based on members' quotas in IMF. Although shown in Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) statements as liabilities,

GLOSSARY

they must be redeemed by ESF only in the event of liquidation of, or U.S. withdrawal from, the SDR department of IMF or cancellation of SDRs.

SDR certificates are issued to the Federal Reserve System against SDRs when SDRs are legalized as money. Proceeds of monetization are deposited into an ESF account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Spot (“Foreign Currency Positions”)—Due for receipt or delivery within 2 workdays.

State and local government series (SLGS) (FD-2)—Special nonmarketable certificates, notes, and bonds offered to State and local governments as a means to invest proceeds from their own tax-exempt financing. Interest rates and maturities comply with IRS arbitrage provisions. SLGS are offered in both time deposit and demand deposit forms. Time deposit certificates have maturities of up to 1 year. Notes mature in 1 to 10 years and bonds mature in more than 10 years. Demand deposit securities are 1-day certificates rolled over with a rate adjustment daily.

Statutory debt limit (FD-6)—By Act of Congress there is a limit, either temporary or permanent, on the amount of public debt that may be outstanding. When this limit is reached, Treasury may not sell new debt issues until Congress

increases or extends the limit. For a detailed listing of changes in the limit since 1941, see the Budget of the United States Government. (See debt outstanding subject to limitation.)

STRIPS (PDO-2)—Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Long-term notes and bonds may be divided into principal and interest-paying components, which may be transferred and sold in amounts as small as $1,000. STRIPS are sold at auction at a minimum par amount, varying for each issue. The amount is an arithmetic function of the issue's interest rate.

Treasury bills—The shortest term Federal security (maturity dates normally varying from 3 to 12 months), are sold at a discount.

Trust fund transaction (“Federal Fiscal Operations”)—An intrabudgetary transaction in which both payments and receipts occur within the same trust fund group.
