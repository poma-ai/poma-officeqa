Profile of the Economy

[Source: Office of Macro economic Analysis]

Real gross domestic product (GDP)

The national accounts measures of inflation showed that price growth continued to be subdued in the second quarter. The GDP price index increased at a 2.5 percent annual rate compared with 3.3 percent in the first quarter. Growth in the first quarter was boosted by the annual Federal pay raise. Excluding food and energy, the core rate increased by 2.1 percent in the second quarter.

Real GDP in creased at a 5.2 per cent an nual rate in the second quar ter of 2000. This fol lowed a 4.8 per cent rate of in-crease in the first quar ter. Fig ures back to 1997 were re vised as part of the an nual re vi sion to the na tional in come and pro duct ac counts. The new data show that real GDP growth a ver aged a strong 4.6 per cent an nual rate since the fi nal quar ter of 1996, higher than pre vi ously esti mated.

Although overall GDP growth accelerated in the second quarter, there were signs that economic activity may be slowing down. Domestic final sales increased at a 5.6 per cent annual pace, about 2 per cent age points less than growth in the first quarter. Most of the deceleration was due to a sharp slowdown in consumer expenditures. Consumer expenditures dropped back to a 3.0 per cent rate, less than half the growth in the first quarter. Slack consumer demand led to a buildup in inventories in the second quarter. That in crease accounted for 1 percentage point of the real GDP growth rate in the second quarter. The growing foreign trade deficit continued to act as a drag on the economy in the second quarter, subtracting 1.5 per cent age points from real growth.

Some components of domestic final demand were strong in the second quarter. Business fixed in vestment, in particular, rose at about a 20 per cent annual rate in both the first and second quarters and accounted for about half of total GDP growth in the first half of 2000. Federal spend ing grew rapidly in the second quarter after a large decline in the first quarter.

Inflation

the first half of 2000, up from 2.9 per cent last year. Core inflation was moderate, increasing at a 1.0 percent annual rate. This is little change from a 0.9 per cent rise in 1999. The increase in energy prices accelerated from a little more than 18 per cent in 1999 to a rate of just under 27 per cent in 2000. Further back in the production chain, core prices for crude goods changed little over the first 6 months of 2000, but increases in prices for core intermediate goods picked up from the modest increase in 1999.

Inflation picked up in the first half of 2000. Much of the acceleration resulted from the energy area where prices rose at a faster pace than in 1999. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, increased but still remained relatively moderate. Extremely strong productivity growth continues to keep labor costs in check.

Consumer prices increased at a 4.2 per cent annual rate during the first half of 2000, an acceleration of about 1-1/2 per cent age points from last year. Higher oil prices were a major factor. Prices of petroleum-based energy products were up at a 45 per-cent annual rate after jumping by almost 30 per cent in 1999. Core Consumer Price Index inflation rose at a 2.6 per cent pace, an acceleration of three-quarters of a percentage point from the 1.9 per cent increase in 1999. That was the smallest yearly increase since 1965. Food prices rose at a 2.2 per cent rate over the first half of 2000.

Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose by a very strong 5.1 percent over the four quarters ending with the second quarter of 2000, more than offsetting an increase of 4.7 percent in hourly compensation. As a result, unit labor costs moved down by 0.4 percent. The employment cost index for total compensation, a separate but closely watched compensation measure computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, increased by 4.4 percent for the 12-month period ending in June, similar to the increase in compensation in the productivity series.

At the pro ducer level, the pat tern for fin ished goods prices has generally mirrored developments at the con sumer level. Finished goods prices in creased at a 4.8 per cent an nual rate in

Employment and unemployment

Job growth slowed during the April-to-July period, but labor markets remained tight with the unemployment rate holding steady near a 30-year low. There were some signs of emerging wage pressures, but, on a year-over-year basis, earnings growth was still moderate.

Nonfarmpay roll employment growth moderated in recent months in part because of the departure of temporary Census workers from Federal payrolls. Even excluding the public sector, however, employment growth slowed during the first 7 months of 2000, averaging just 175,000 jobs per month

compared to 202,000 in 1999. Job gains in the private service-producing sector, the largest source of job growth throughout this expansion, have dwindled to an average of 148,000 per month in 2000, and 60,000 in the 3 months ended in July, from roughly 200,000 per month during 1998 and 1999. Construction employment also has expanded more slowly in recent months following a weather-related surge earlier in 2000. Employment in manufacturing and mining is starting to recover, but job gains so far have recouped very little of the steep losses suffered in 1998 and 1999.

The economy continues to operate at a very high rate of labor utilization. The unemployment rate remained at 4.0 percent for a second straight month in July, up slightly from a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in April. The share of the working age population employed has declined since hitting a record-high 64.9 per cent in April, but at 64.2 per cent is still quite high.

Wage gains have remained surprisingly low given recent labor market conditions. Average hourly earnings of production and other nonsupervisory workers grew by 3.7 per cent over the 12 months ended in July. The pace of earnings growth has remained more or less stable at that level for about a year and a half after rising as high as 4.4 per cent in early 1998. In real terms, earnings declined by 0.3 per cent over the 12 months ended in June (the latest month for which these data are available), reflecting higher inflation as a result of the oil price hike.

Real disposable personal income and consumer spending

Personal income in nominal terms rose some what faster during the first half of 2000 compared to the first half of 1999. But, on a real, after-tax basis, income growth has slowed slightly. Nominal personal income rose at a 6.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2000 and at a similar 6.7 per cent pace during the first half. This is up from a 5.6 per cent increase during all of 1999. Employee compensation, in the first half of 2000, and transfer payments all grew faster in the first half of 2000 than during 1999. Transfer payments were boosted by the annual cost-of-living in crease to Federal programs in the first quarter and by a legislative change raising Social Security payments in the second quarter. Social Security beneficiaries 65 years and older are now permitted to receive full benefits regardless of earnings, whereas prior law had reduced benefits by $1 for every $3 over the annual earnings limit of $17,000. Real disposable (after-tax) personal income in creased at a 3.4 per cent annual rate in the second quarter but during the first half of 2000 slowed to a 2.7 per cent pace from 3.1 per cent during 1999. The slow down in 2000 reflected some what higher inflation, mainly because of higher oil prices, as well as faster growth of tax payments.

Real consumer spending rose at a 3.0 per cent annual rate in the second quarter. This followed a huge 7.6 per cent pace of advance in the first quarter. During the first half of 2000, growth of personal consumption averaged a 5.3 percent annual rate – very close to the 5.6 per cent in crease during all of 1999. While spending on motor vehicles has slowed, it remains at a high level. Consumers outlays for other discretionary items, such as furniture and appliances, clothing, and recreation, continue to advance rapidly.

The greater in crease in spend ing than in dis pos able in come dur ing the first half of 2000 pulled the personal sav ing rate down to only 0.2 per cent in each of the first two quar ters of the year from 1.5 per cent in the fourth quar ter. The lat est fig ures are the low est since neg ative sav ing was re corded in 1933. The sav ing rate has de clined steadily from a re cent high of 8.7 per cent in 1992. This de cline was pri mar ily be cause of the grow- ing “wealth ef fect” re sult ing from the rise in the stock mar ket. In creases in as set val ues are not counted as in come in the

national income and product accounts, from which saving is calculated, but nonetheless contribute to the willingness of consumers to spend.

Industrial production and capacity utilization

In dust trial activity continues to accelerate. During the first half of 2000, production in manufacturing, mining and utilities rose at a vig orous 6.6 per cent annual rate, building on 1999's 4.7 per cent advance. In 1998, a slow down in manufacturing production in due by the Asian crisis held growth of in dust trial production to a lack luster 2.5 per cent.

Manufacturing production, which accounts for just over 88 percent of all industrial output, has risen at a 6.9 per cent annual rate so far in 2000 compared to an increase of 5.1 per cent during all of 1999. A handful of high-tech industries, including computers, communications equipment and semiconductors, has fueled the pickup, with an annual rate gain approaching 65 percent in 2000. Excluding the high-tech sector, factory output has crept only 0.5 per cent higher, a little less than one-third of 1999's 1.6 percent advance. Production in the mining industry (5-1/2 percent of industrial output) continued to rebound in the first 6 months of 2000, increasing by 6.0 per cent at an annual rate compared to 1.4 per cent in 1999. Output in mining had plunged by 7.1 per cent during 1998, when falling oil prices sharply curtailed activity in oil and gas extraction.

Substantial production gains combined with slower capacity building have boosted the rate of capacity utilization in 2000. In July, the industrial operating rate stood at 82.1 per cent, just below the 2-year high of 82.2 per cent reached in May but a notch above its long-term average of 82.0 per cent. Despite a 1.7 per cent age point jump over the past year and a half, this rate still remains 2.3 per cent age points below the expansion high of 84.4 per cent reached in January 1995.

Nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs

Despite the record length of the current expansion, U.S. productivity growth has accelerated not slowed, as is typical in the late stages of an expansion. Nonfarm business productivity (real output per hour worked) jumped by 5.3 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2000, bringing the rise over

6

PRO FILE OF THE ECON OMY

the last four quarters to 5.1 per cent. That was the fastest rate of growth for any four-quarter period since 1983, when the economy was emerging from deep recession. Over the past 5 years, nonfarm productivity has risen at a 2.8 percent annual rate, double the rate averaged over the previous two decades. This exceptional performance has been widely attributed to innovations and investment in information technology and - ports the view that productivity growth has moved to a higher trend rate in recent years.

Hourly compensation costs in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 5.3 per cent annual rate in the second quarter, up a bit from the modest 3.9 per cent pace recorded in the first quarter. Robust productivity growth more than offset these costs, and, as a result, labor costs per unit of output declined at a 0.1 per cent annual rate in the second quarter and by 0.4 per cent over the four quarters of 1999. Subdued growth of unit labor costs has played a key role in helping contain inflation.

Productivity in the manufacturing sector continues to grow at an impressive pace although growth has moderated somewhat since late 1999. In the second quarter of 2000, factory output per hour slowed to a 5.1 per cent annual rate from an annual rate of 7.9 per cent in the previous quarter and 10.2 per-cent in the final quarter of 1999. However, the 6.9 per cent gain posted over the last four quarters was the strongest in nearly 30 years. Hourly compensation costs were up by 4.4 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter. With productivity growth outstripping the cost of compensation, unit labor costs eased at a 0.7 per cent rate. Factory unit labor costs have been falling for 6-1/2 years and are now 9.4 per cent below the high reached in late 1993.

Current account balance

The current account measures trade in goods and services as well as the flow of investment income and unilateral transfers. The current account has been in deficit almost continuously since the early 1980s. In the first quarter of 2000, the current account deficit swelled to $409.2 billion at an annual rate. This represents an all-time high 4.2 per cent share of nominal GDP.

The deficit has widened substantially over the past decade primarily because of a deterioration in the merchandise trade balance. Growth in U.S. domestic demand has recently outpaced that of our major trading partners, causing imports to grow much more rapidly than exports. The appreciation of the dollar from 1995 to early 1998 and higher prices for imported oil over the past year and a half have also contributed to the widening trade gap. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit has more than doubled since the mid-1990s, reaching a new high of $423.4 billion at an annual rate in the first quarter. It continued to rise in the second quarter.

Other major components of the current account also have fueled the growing deficit. The surplus on trade in services has narrowed since 1997. Moreover, what had been a positive balance on investment in come turned negative in 1998 as weak foreign growth depressed interest earnings on U.S. investments abroad and U.S. growth supported strong interest income on foreign investments in the United States. The balance on investment income is likely to remain negative in the future, since the accumulation of current account deficits has resulted in an increase in net foreign holdings of U.S. assets and a negative international investment position.

The current account deficit is, by definition, matched by offsetting transactions in the financial and capital accounts, with any difference in the recorded flows listed as a statistical discrepancy. In the first quarter of 2000, recorded inflows for foreign as sets in the United States exceeded out flows for U.S. as sets abroad by $286.9 billion at an annual rate. A jump in net foreign purchases of U.S. securities, particularly equities, led the increase.

Exchange rate of the dollar

The ex change rate of the dol lar against a broad in dex of cur rencies of important U.S. trading partners in creased marked ly from 1995 to the fall of 1998. This was because economic growth in this coun try out paced that of most of the U.S. tradi ng partners. After some vol a til ity late in 1998, the ex change rate lev el ed out in 1999 be fore ris ing again since Oc tober. The doll ar lev e preci ated a bit from mid-May through mid- June as expec tations for further in terest rate in creases in the U.S. rela tive to for e ign in terest rates di min ished. The doll ar moved back up through July and was up by 3.4 per cent since Oc to ber against the broad in dex of cur renc ies.

All of the appreciation since October was against the major currencies of the most important U.S. trading partners. These currencies consist of the euro plus those of other major partners such as Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. Since October 1999, the dollar has in creased by 6.2 percent against that narrow range of major currencies. The dollar eased slightly against the currencies of other important trading partners between October and March but appreciated through July.

The performance of the dollar against the aggregate index of major currencies masks divergent patterns among individual currencies. The dollar appreciated by more than 14 per cent from October to July against the euro. The exchange rate against the yen has been more volatile. Since its most recent peak in August 1998, the exchange rate of the dollar against the yen fell by almost 30 per cent through last December. The yen strengthened amid expectations that a recovery in the Japanese economy was imminent. In addition, strong foreign interest in Japanese equities helped augment the yen's rise. Since December, the dollar improved by 5.5 per cent against the yen.

Interest rates

Short-term market interest rates in creased from June 1999 through this May as the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy. The tightening moves were made in response to concern that faster growth in demand than in potential supply could result in inflation. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates three times in 1999 by a total of 75 basis points, which reversed the easing moves made in 1998 during the period of global financial turmoil. The Federal Reserve increased rates three more times in 2000 by a total of 100 basis points (1 percentage point). The six increases raised the key federal funds target rate (the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans) from 4.75 per cent to 6.50 per cent. The discount rate (the rate the Federal Reserve charges banks for short-term funds) was raised from 4.50 per cent to 6.0 per cent. The market

in ter est rate for the 3-month Trea sury bill, which usu ally cen-ters around the level of the dis count rate, was about 6.0 per cent at the end of July.

Rates on long-term Treasury securities increased through 1999 and in early 2000 as eco nomic growth con tin ued to ex pand at a rapid pace.

The interest rate on a conventional 30-year fixed rate loan rose from a 30-year low of 6.7 per cent in Oc to ber 1998 to a re cent high of 8.5 per cent in April 2000. By July, the rate had dipped back to about 8.2 percent. The higher mortgage interest rates since 1998 have dampened housing activity.

Long-term Interest Rates

Housing

Activity in the housing market is slowing. The effects of rising mortgage interest rates are being to outweigh support from rapid gains in employment and income and the wealth effects of rising stock prices.

Sales of new single-family homes averaged an annual rate of 853,000 in the second quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was down from a sizable 926,000 pace in the first quarter when activity was stronger than normal because of unusually mild weather. In 1999, a record 907,000 new single-family homes were sold. Sales of existing single-family homes also reached a record last year of 5.1 million and have since eased lower.

The high level of sales of both new and ex ist ing homes over the past several years has led to a dramatic increase in homeownership. Since the be gin ning of 1993, the num ber of

new home own ers grew by more than 9 mil lion. In the sec ond quar ter of 2000, the homeownership rate rose to 67.2 per cent, an all-time re cord.

Con struc tion of new hous ing units on a sea son ally ad justed ba sis showed the same pat tern as new home sales in the first and sec ond quar ters of 2000. Starts of sin gle-fam ily homes de-clined to an an nual rate of 1.26 mil lion in the sec ond quar ter from 1.34 mil lion in the first quar ter. The drop in multi-fam ily starts was even more dram atic, but those fig ures are typ ically very vol a tile. Per mit au tho ri za tions for fu ture hous ing con-struc tion, gen erally a more sta ble mea sure than starts, de-clined or re mained un changed in 5 of the first 6 months of 2000, con-firm ing a slow ing trend in hous ing con struc tion.

The value of residential investment in real terms accelerated a bit in the second quarter but over the past four quarters was up by only 1.1 percent. This was the lowest four-quarter growth rate in almost 3 years and was far below a recent peak of 10.3 per cent over the four quarters of 1998.

PRO FILE OF THE ECON OMY

Federal budget

The Federal budget surplus continued to grow through the first three quarters of fiscal 2000. According to the Administration’s “Mid-Session Review of the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget” (MSR), the surplus is projected to rise to $211 billion in fiscal 2000. More recent data suggest that figure will be exceeded. Fiscal 2000 will mark the third consecutive year of Federal budget surplus after 28 years of deficits. The surplus grew to $124 billion in fiscal 1999 from $69 billion in fiscal 1998. Strong economic growth and passage of deficit reduction programs placed the deficit on a downward course after it reached an all-time high of $290 billion in fiscal 1992. The surpluses are estimated to reduce the amount of Federal debt held by the public by a total of more than $355 billion by the end of fiscal 2000.

Since 1992, growth in Federal outlays has remained re-strained while strong growth in jobs, in come and cap it al gains has boosted re ceipts. Out lays in creased just 3.0 per cent in fis-cal 1999 and dipped to 18.7 per cent in re la tion toGDP, the low-est rate in 25 years. Out lays are ex pected to grow some what faster in fis cal 2000 but by much less than re ceipts. Re ceipts are projected to rise by more than 10 per cent in fis cal 2000, up from 6.1 per cent in fis cal 1999 and the larg est in crease in 13 years. Im prove ment in cor porate prof its and strong in creases in in di vidual in come and cap it al gains have driven the ac cele of a tion in tax re ceipts this fis cal year.

The MSR forecasted that surpluses will continue to grow. By directing the surpluses to ward continued debt reduction, firming the long-run solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and making investments to enhance the economic expansion, the $3.6 trillion debt held by the public at the end of fiscal 1999 could be completely paid off by 2012.

Net national saving and investment

Net national saving averaged 6.6 percent of net national product (NNP) in the first quarter of 2000. This was similar to the 6.8 per cent for all of 1999 but down from 7.5 per cent in 1998. (Net saving and NNP exclude depreciation to replace wornout or obsolete equipment, software and structures used in production.) Figures from 1997 forward were revised in late July, reflecting the regular incorporation of new data into the

national income and product accounts. National saving rates were marked down for all 3 years, as both per sonal and corporate income were lower than previously estimated. Re cent fig ures none- theless remained consider- ably above the 3.9 per cent of 1993, the low est for any year since the 1930s.

The swing in the Federal budget from large deficits into surplus has more than accounted for the improvement in national saving since 1993. As a result, the public sector moved from dissaving equivalent to 4.7 percent of NNP in 1993 (and an even larger 5.4 percent in 1992) to saving of 3.4 percent in the

first quarter of 2000. Despite the progress, net saving still remains well below the 11.6 percent of NNP averaged in the 1950s and 1960s.

Pri vate sav ing de clined from a re cent high of 9.4 per cent of NNPin 1992 to 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. A sharp fall in sav ing by house holds more than off set a gain in cor po rate sav ing. In creased wealh gen er ated by a sur ing stock mar ket is an im por tant fac tor in the re duced de sire of house

(Saving as a percent of NNP)

holds to save out of cur rent income. In the first quarter of 2000, personal saving was equivalent to only 0.1 percent of NNP, down from 7.4 per cent in 1992. Growth of corporate profits, on the other hand, lifted net corporate saving from 2.2 percent of NNP in 1992 to 3.1 percent in the first quarter.

Net domestic investment (by government and private industry in structures, equipment, software and inventory) increased from a very low 5.2 percent of NNP in 1991 to 10.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2000. A large portion of this investment has been financed from abroad, as U.S. net foreign investment swung from 0.3 per cent of NNP in 1991 to -4.6 percent in the first quarter.

INTRODUCTION: Federal Fiscal Operations

Budget authority usully takes the form of ap pro pri a tions that al low obligationsto be in curred and pay ments to be made. Reappropriations are Congressional actions that extend the availability of unobligated amounts that have ex pired or would oth er wise ex pire. These are counted as new bud get authority in the fis cal year of the leg is la tion in which thereappropriation act is in cluded, re gard less of when the amounts were orig inally ap- pro pri ated or when they would oth er wise lapse.

Obligations generally are liqui dated by the issuance of checks or the disbursement of cash—outlays. Obligations may also be liqui dated (and outlays recorded) by the accrual of interest on public issues of Treasury debt securities (including an increase in redemption value of bonds outstanding); or by the issuance of bonds, debentures, notes, monetary credits, or electronic payments.

Refunds of collections generally are treated as reductions of collections, whereas payments for earned-income tax credits in excess of tax liabilities are treated as outlays. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years or in the same year. Outlays, there fore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior year budget authority and from budget authority provided for the year in which the money is spent. Total outlays include both budget and off-budget outlays and are stated net of offsetting collections.

Receipts are reported in the tables as either budget receipts or offsetting collections. They are collections from the public, excluding receipts offset against outlays. These, also called governmental receipts, consist mainly of tax receipts (including social insurance taxes), receipts from court fines, certain licenses, and deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve system. Refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts. Total Government receipts are compared with total outlays in calculating the budget surplus or deficit.

Offsetting collections from other Government accounts or the public are of a business-type or market-oriented nature. They are classified as either collections credited to appropriations or fund accounts, or offsetting receipts (i.e., amounts deposited in receipts accounts). The former normally can be used without appropriation act by Congress. These occur in two instances: (1) when authorized by law, amounts collected for materials or services are treated as reimbursement to appropriations. For accounting purposes, earned reimbursements are also known as revenues. These offsetting collections are netted against gross outlays in determining net outlays from such appropriations; and (2) in the three types of revolving funds (public enterprise, intragovernmental and trust); offsetting collections are netted against spending, and outlays are reported as the net amount.

Offsetting receipts in receipt accounts cannot be used without appropriation. They are subdivided into three categories: (1) proprietary receipts, or collections from the public, offset against outlays by agency and by function; (2) intragovernmental transactions, or payments into receipt accounts from governmental appropriation or fund accounts.

They finance operations within and between Government agencies and are credited with collections from other Government accounts; and (3) offsetting governmental receipts which include foreign cash contributions.

Intrabudgetary transactions are subdivided into three categories: (1) interfund transactions—payments are from one fund group (either Federal funds or trust funds) to a receipt account in the other fund group; (2) Federal intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the Federal fund group; and (3) trust intrafund transactions—payments and receipts both occur within the trust fund group.

Off setting receipts are generally deducted from budget authority and out lays by function, subfunction, or agency. There are four types of receipts, however, that are deducted from budget totals as undistributed offsetting receipts. They are: (1) agencies' payments (including payments by off-budget Federal entities) as employers into employees' retirement funds; (2) interest received by trust funds; (3) rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf; and (4) other interest (i.e., that collected on Outer Continental Shelf money in deposit funds when such money is transferred into the budget).

The Government has used the unified budget concept set forth in the “Report of the President’s Commission on Budget Concepts” as a foundation for its budgetary analysis and presentation since 1969. The concept calls for the budget to include all of the Government’s fiscal transactions with the public. Since 1971, however, various laws have been enacted removing several Federal entities from (or creating them out of) the budget. Other laws have moved certain off-budget Federal entities onto the budget. Under current law, the off-budget Federal entities consist of the two Social Security trust funds, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Postal Service.

Although an off-budget Federal entity's receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit or disparity are not subject to targets set by the Congressional resolution, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (2 United States Code 900-922)] included off-budget surplus or deficit in calculating deficit targets under that act and in calculating excess deficit. Partly for this reason, attention has focused on both on- and off-budget receipts, outlays and deficit of the Government.

Tables FFO-1, FFO-2 and FFO-3 are published quarterly and cover 5 years of data, es ti mates for 2 years, de tail for 13 months, and fis cal year-to-date data. They pro vide a sum mary of data relating to Federal fiscal operations reported by Federal enti- ties and dis burs ing of fi cers, and daily re ports from the FRBs.

Table FFO-1 summarizes the amount of total receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit, as well as transactions in Federal securities, monetary assets and balances in Treasury operating cash.

Table FFO-2 in cludes on- and off-budget re ceipts by source. Amounts represent income taxes, social insurance taxes, net contributions for other insurance and retirement, excise taxes, estate and gift taxes, customs duties and net miscellaneous receipts.

Table FFO-3 details on- and off-budget outlays by agency.

Table FF0-4 sum ma rizes on- and off-budget re ceipts by source and outlays by func tion as re ported to each ma jor fund group clas si fication for the current fis cal year to date and prior fis cal year to date.

Table FFO-5 summarizes internal revenue receipts by regions and districts and by type of tax. Amounts reported are collections made in a fiscal year. They span several tax liability years because they consist of prepayments (estimated tax payments and taxes withheld by employers for individual income and Social Security taxes), payments made with tax returns and subsequent payments made after tax returns are due or are filed (that is, payments with delinquent returns or on delinquent accounts).

Amounts are re ported based on the pri mary fil ing ad dress provided by each tax payer or re port ing en tity. For multistate cor po ra tions, the ad dress may re flect only the district where such a corpo ra tion re ported its taxes from a prin ci pal of fice rather than other districts where in come was earned or where individual income and Social Se cu rity taxes were with held. In ad di tion, an in di vid ual may re side in one dis trict and work in another.

Third-Quarter Receipts

The following capsule analysis of budget receipts, by source, for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 supplements fiscal data reported in the June issue of the "Treasury Bulletin." At the time of that issue's release, not enough data were available to analyze adequately collections for the quarter.

Individual income taxes—Individual income tax receipts, net of re funds, were $348.4 bil lion for the third quar ter of fis cal 2000. This is an in crease of $60.0 bil lion over the com pa ra ble prior year quar ter. With held re ceipts in creased by $17.6 bil lion and non-withheld re ceipts in creased by $35.2 bil lion during this pe riod. Re funds de creased by $7.1 bil lion over the com pa ra ble fis cal 1999 quar ter. There was a de crease of $2.1 bil lion in ac counting adjustments between individual income tax receipts and the So cial Se cu rity and Medicare trust funds over the com pa ra ble quar ter in fiscal 1999.

Corporation income taxes—Net corpo rate in come tax receipts were $74.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2000. This is an in crease of $9.1 bil lion com pared to the prior year third quar ter. The $9.1 bil lion change is com prised of an in- crease of $6.7 bil lion in es ti mated and fí nal pay ments, and a de crease of $2.4 bil lion in corpo rate re funds.

Employment taxes and contributions—Employment taxes and contributions receipts for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 were $174.3 billion, an increase of $14.2 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. Receipts to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, Federal Disability Insurance, and Federal Hospital Insurance trust funds increased by $7.9 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3.6 billion respectively. There was a $2.1 billion accounting adjustment for prior years employment tax liabilities made in the third quarter of fiscal 2000. There was no comparable adjustment made in the third quarter of fiscal 1999.

Unemployment insurance—Unemployment insurance receipts, net of refunds, for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 were $13.6 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion over the comparable quarter of fiscal 1999. Net State taxes deposited in the U.S. Treasury in creased by $0.7 billion to $9.9 billion. Net Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) taxes in creased by $0.3 billion to $3.7 billion.

Contributions for other in sur ance and re tire ment— Contributions for other retirement were $1.2 bil lion for the third quarter of fiscal 2000. There was a neg li gi ble in crease over receipts from the comparable quarter of fiscal 1999. The growth in con tri bu tions will re main rel a tively flat over the next few years as the num ber of em ploy ees cov ered by the Fed eral Employ ees’ Retire ment System (FERS) grows slowly relative to those covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).

Ex cise taxes—Net ex cise tax re ceipts for the third quar ter of fis cal 2000 were $17.4 bil lion, an in crease of $1.0 bil lion over the com par able prior year quar ter. To tal ex cise tax refunds for the quar ter were $0.4 billion, not a significant change over the com par able prior year quar ter.

Estate and gift taxes—Net es tate and gift tax re ceipts were $8.8 billion for the third quarter of fis cal 2000. These receipts represent a decrease of $0.1 billion over the same quarter in fiscal 1999.

Customs duties—Customs duties net of refunds were $4.9 bil lion for the third quar ter of fis cal 2000. This is an in- crease of $0.7 bil lion over the com pa ra ble prior year quarter.

Miscellaneous receipts—Net miscellaneous receipts for the third quarter of fiscal 2000 were $13.4 billion, an increase of $6.1 billion over the comparable prior year quarter. The fiscal 2000 third quarter amount in cludes a transfer of $3.8 billion from the surplus funds of the Federal Reserve System to the Treasury as required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal 2000.

INTRODUCTION: Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The Department of Treasury's (Treasury) operating cash is maintained in accounts with the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) and branches, as well as in tax and loan accounts in other financial institutions. Major information sources include the Daily Balance Wire received from the FRBs and branches, and electronic transfers through the Letter of Credit Payment, Fedline Payment and Fedwire Deposit Systems. As the FRB accounts are depleted, funds are called in (withdrawn) from thousands of tax and loan accounts at financial institutions throughout the country.

Under authority of Public Law 95-147, Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositaries maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury tax and loan investment program, depositary financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate. Financial institutions wishing to retain funds deposited into their tax and loan accounts in inter-

est-bearing obligations participate under the Note Option. The program permits Treasury to collect funds through financial institutions and to leave the funds in Note Option depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way, Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuating operations on Note Option financial institution reserves and on the economy. Likewise, those institutions wishing to remit the funds to the Treasury account at FRBs do so under the Remittance Option.

De posits to tax and loan ac counts oc cur as cus tom ers of fi nan cial in sti tu tions de posit tax pay ments, which the fi nan cial institutions use to purchase Government securities. In most cases, this in volves a trans fer of funds from a cus tomer’s ac- count to the tax and loan ac count in the same fi nan cial in sti tu tion. Also, Trea sury can di rect the FRBs to in vest ex cess funds in tax and loan ac counts di rectly from the Trea sury ac count at the FRBs.

INTRODUCTION:Federal Debt

Treasury securities (i.e., public debt securities) comprise most of the Federal debt, with securities is sued by other Federal agencies account ing for the rest. Tables in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" reflect the total. Further detailed in for- mation is published in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." Like wise, information on agency securities and on investments of Federal Government accounts in Federal securities is published in the "Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Out lays of the United States Government."

Table FD-1 sum marizes the Fed eral debt by listing public debt and agency se curi ties held by the public, in cluding the Federal Reserve. It also includes debt held by Federal agen cies, largely by the So cial Se cu rity and other Fed eral re- tire ment trust funds. The net un am or tized pre mium and dis- count also are listed by total Federal se curi ties, se curi ties held by Government ac counts and se curi ties held by the public. The dif ference be tween the out stand ing face value of the Fed eral debt and the net un am or tized pre mium and dis count is clas si- fied as the ac crual amount. (For greater de tail on hold ings of Federal se curi ties by par tic u lar classes of in ves tors, see the ownership tables, OFS-1 and OFS-2.)

Table FD-2 categorizes by type in ter est-bearing mar-ketable and nonmarketable Treasury securities. The difference between in ter est-bearing and to tal pub lic debt se cu ri ties re-flects out stand ing matured Treasur y se cu rities — that is, unre-deemed securities that have matured and are no longer ac cru ing in ter est. Be cause the Federal Fi nancing Bank is un-der the super vision of Treasury, its securities are held by a U.S. Government account.

Intable FD-3, nonmarketable Treasury securities held by U.S. Government accounts are summarized by is sues to particular funds within Government. Many of the funds in vest in par value special series nonmarketables at in ter est rates de- termined by law. Others in vest in market-based special Treasury securities whose terms mirror those of marketable securities.

Table FD-4 presents in terest-bearing se curities is sued by Gov ern ment agen cies. Fed eral agency bor row ing has de- clined in re cent years, in part be cause the Fed eral Fi nancing Bank has pro vided fi nanc ing to other Fed eral agen cies. (Fed- eral agency bor rowing from Treasury is presented in the “Monthly Treas ury State ment of Re ceipts and Out lays of the United States Gov ern ment.”)

Table FD-5 illustrates the average length of marketable interest-bearing public debt held by private investors and the maturity distribution of that debt.

The average length hit a low of 2 years, 5 months in December 1975. The length then gradually increased until it reached a high of 6 years, 4 months in May 1991. Since then, the average length has decreased. For example, during most of 1996 the average length was at 5 years, 3 months.

In March 1971, Con gress en acted a lim ited ex cep tion to the amount of bonds with rates greater than 4-1/4 per cent that could be held by the pub lic. This per mit ted Trea sury to of fer securitiesmaturingin more than 7 years at cur rent mar ket in ter est rates for the first time since 1965. In March 1976, the def i ni tion of a bond was changed to in clude those se cu ri ties longerthan 10 years to ma tu rity. This ex cep tion has ex panded since 1971, au tho riz ing Trea sury to con tinue to is sue long- term se cu ri ties. The ceil ing on Trea sury bonds was re pealed on No vem ber 10, 1988.

The volume of privately held Treasury marketable securities by maturity class reflects the remaining period to maturity of Treasury bills, notes and bonds. The average length is comprised of an average of remaining periods to maturity, weighted by the amount of each security held by private investors. In other words, computations of average length exclude Government accounts and the FRBs.

In table FD-6, the debt ceiling is compared with the outstanding debt subject to limitation by law. The other debt category includes Federal debt Congress has designated as being subject to the debt ceiling. Changes in the non-interest-bearing debt shown in the last column reflect maturities of Treasury securities on nonbusiness days, which can be redeemed on the next business day.

Table FD-7 details Treasury holdings of securities issued by Government corporations and other agencies. Certain Federal agencies are authorized to borrow money from the Treasury, largely to finance direct loan programs. In addition, agencies such as the Bonneville Power Administration are authorized to borrow from the Treasury to finance capital projects. Treasury, in turn, finances these loans by selling Treasury securities to the public.

INTRODUCTION: Public Debt Operations

Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code allows the Secretary of Treasury to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities. The Secretary determines the terms and conditions of issue, conversion, maturity, payment and interest rate. New issues of Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years. Bonds mature in more than 10 years from the issue date. Each marketable security is listed in the "Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States." The information in this section of the "Treasury Bulletin" pertains only to marketable Treasury securities, current bills, notes and bonds.

Table PDO-1 provides a maturity schedule of interest-bearing marketable public debt securities other than regular weekly and 52-week bills. All unmatured Treasury notes and bonds are listed in maturity order, from earliest to latest. A separate breakout is provided for the combined holdings of the Government accounts and Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs), so that the "all other investors" category includes all private holdings.

TablePDO-2 presents the results of weekly auctions of 13- and 26-week bills, as well as auctions of 52-week bills.

Treasury bills mature each Thurs day. New is sues of 13-week bills are reopening of 26-week bills. New is sues of cash management bills also are pre sented. High yields on accepted tenders and the dol lar value of to tal bids are pre sented, with the dol lar value of awards made both on a com pet itive and non competitive basis.

Treasury ac cepts non compet itive ten ders of up to $1 mil lion for bills and $5 mil lion for notes and bonds in each auc tion of securities to encourage participation of individuals and smaller in stitutions.

Ta blePDO-3 lists the results of auctions of marketable securities, other than weekly bills, in chronological order over the past 2 years. Included are: notes and bonds from table PDO-1, 52-week bills from table PDO-2, and data for cash management bills.

Ta blePDO-4i di cates the to tal amount of mar ket able securities allotted to each class of inv estor. The FRBs tally into in ves tor classes the ten ders in each auc tion of mar ket able se cu ri ties other than weekly auc tions of 13- and 26-week bills.

INTRODUCTION: Ownership of Federal Securities

Federal securities presented in the following tables are public debt securities such as savings bonds, bills, notes and bonds that the Treasury issues. The tables also detail debt issued by other Federal agencies under special financing authorities. [See the Federal debt (FD) tables for a more complete description of the Federal debt.]

Table OFS-1 presents Treasury marketable and non-marketable securities and debt issued by other Federal agencies held by Government accounts, the FRBs and private investors. Social Security and Federal retirement trust fund investments comprise much of the Government account holdings.

The FRBs acquire Treasury securities in the market as a means of executing monetary policy.

Table OFS-2 presents the estimated amount of public debt securities held by private investors. Information is obtained from sources such as the Federal financial institution regulatory agencies. State, local and foreign holdings include special issues of nonmarketable securities to municipal entities and for eign official ac counts. They also include municipal, foreign official and private holdings of marketable Treasury securities. (See footnotes to the table for description of investor categories.)

MARKET YIELDS

INTRODUCTION: Market Yields

The tables and charts in this section present yields on Treasury marketable securities, and compare long-term yields on Treasury securities with yields on long-term corporate and municipal securities.

Table MY-1 lists Treasury market bid yields at constant maturity ties for bills, notes and bonds. The Treasury yield curve in the accompanying chart is based on current market bid quotations on the most actively traded Treasury securities as of 3:30 p.m. on the last business day of the calendar quarter.

The Treasury uses quotations obtained by the FRB of New York to de rive the yield curve, based on semi an nual interest pay ments and read at con stant ma tu rity points to de- velop a consistent data series. Yields on Treasury bills are coupon equivalent yields of bank discount rates at which Trea sury bills trade in the mar ket. The Board of Gov ernors of

the Federal Reserve System publishes the Treasury constant maturity data series in its weekly H.15 press release.

Table MY-2 shows average yields of long-term Treasury, corporate and municipal bonds. The long-term Treasury average yield is the 30-year constant maturity yield. The corporate bond average yield is developed by Treasury by calculating reoffering yields on new long-term securities maturing in at least 20 years and rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service. The municipal bond average yield prior to 1991 was compiled by Treasury. Beginning with January 1991, the average yield is the "Municipal Bond Yield Average," published by Moody's Investors Service for 20-year reoffering yields on selected Aa-rated general obligations. See the footnotes for further explanation.

INTRODUCTION: U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation

The U.S. Currency and Coin Outstanding and in Circulation (USCC) statement informs the public of the total face value of currency and coin used as a medium of exchange that is in circulation at the end of a given accounting month. The statement defines the total amount of currency and coin outstanding and the portion deemed to be in circulation. It includes some old and current rare issues that do not circulate or that may do so to a limited extent. Treasury includes them in the statement because the issues were originally intended for general circulation.

The USCC statement provides a description of the various issues of paper money. It also gives an estimated average of currency and coin held by each individual, using estimates of population from the Bureau of the Census. USCC information has been published by Treasury since 1888, and was published separately until 1983, when it was incorporated into the "Treasury Bulletin." The USCC comes from monthly reports compiled by Treasury offices, various U.S. Mint offices, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve Board.

CAPITALMOVEMENTS

INTRODUCTION: Capital Movements

Treasury collects information about the transference of financial as sets and other portfolio capital movements between the United States and foreigners and has since 1935. Commercial banks and other depository institutions, bankholding companies, securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enter prises in the United States file capital movement reports with district FRBs. Beginning in late 1998, the Federal Reserve Board also performs services on behalf of the Treasury in support of this data collection system.

Forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultation with representatives of banks, securities firms and nonbanking enterprises. Copies of the reporting forms and instructions may be obtained from the Office of Program Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220; the International Finance Division, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551; or district FRBs.

In general, in for mation is re ported op po site the coun try or geo graph ical area where the for eigner is lo cated, as shown on records of reportinginstitutions. However, in formation may not al ways re flect the ul ti mate own er ship of as sets. Re porting in sti tu tions are not re quired to go be yond ad dresses shown on their re cords and so may not be aware of the ac tual coun try of domicile of the ul ti mate bene ficiary.

Trans actions with branches or agen cies of for eign of fi cial institutions, wherever located, are reported oppo site the country that has sovereignty over the institutions. Transactions with international and regional organizations are not reported oppo site any country, but are ac counted for in re gional group ings of such organizations. The only excep tion is information pertain ing to the Bank for In ter national Settle ments, which is re ported oppo site “Other Europe.”

Banks and other depositary institutions, bank holding companies, International Banking Facilities (IBFs), securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States must file reports. These enterprises include the branches, agencies, subsidiaries and other affiliates in the United States of foreign banking and nonbanking firms. Those with liabilities, claims or securities transactions be low specified exemption levels are exempt from reporting.

Banks and other depositors institutions, and some brokers and dealers, file monthly reports covering their dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, foreigners in a number of countries. Twice a year, June 30 and December 31, they also report the same liabilities and claims items attributed to foreigners in countries not shown separately on the monthly reports. Quarterly reports are filed for liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies. The exemption level applicable to these banking reports is $15 million.

Banks and other depository institutions, securities brokers and dealers, and other enterprises report monthly their transactions with foreigners in long-term securities. They must report

securities transactions with foreigners if their agreagategate purchases or their agreagategate sales amount to at least $2 million during the covered month.

Exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions and brokers), and other nonbanking enterprises must file reports quarterly if liabilities to, or claims on, unaffiliated foreigners amount to $10 million or more at the end of the covered quarter.

Nonbanking enterprises also report each month their aggregate U.S. dollar denominated deposit and certificates of deposit claims of $10 million or more on banks abroad.

The data in these tables do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and other countries. The principal exceptions are the intercompany capital transactions of nonbanking business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies (own foreign offices) and capital transactions of the U.S. Government. Consolidated data on all types of international capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) in its regular reports on the U.S. balance of payments.

Section I presents liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks and other depository institutions, as well as brokers and dealers. Dollar liabilities are reported monthly; those denominated in foreign currencies are reported quarterly. Respondents report certain of their own liabilities and a wide range of their custody liabilities to foreigners.

Section II presents claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks and other depository institutions, brokers and dealers. Data on banks' claims held for their own account are collected monthly. In formation on claims held for their domestic customers as well as on foreign currency claims is collected on a quarterly basis only. Maturity data are reported according to time remaining to maturity. Reporting also covers certain items held by brokers and dealers in the United States.

Section III contains supplementary data on dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, countries not listed separately on the monthly reports submitted by banks, other depositary institutions, brokers and dealers in the United States. The supplementary reports are filed semiannually as of the end of June and December.

Section IV shows the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners of exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions (other than banks, other depository institutions and brokers), and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. In formation does not include accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. These are reported by business enterprises to Commerce on its direct investment forms. Data

exclude claims on foreigners held through banks in the United States.

Section V contains information on transactions with foreigners in long-term domestic and foreign securities as reported by banks, brokers and other entities in the United States. The data cover transactions executed in the United States for the accounts of foreigners and transactions executed abroad for the accounts of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. This includes transactions in newly issued securities as well as transactions in and redemptions of outstanding issues. However, the data do not include nonmarketable Treasury bonds and notes shown in table IFS-3.

The geographical break down of the transactions data does not necessarily reflect the domicile of the ultimate owners or the original issuers of the securities. This is because the path of a security is not tracked prior to its being purchased from, or after it is sold to, a foreigner in a reportable transaction. That is, before it enters and after it departs the reporting system, own-

er ship of a security may be transferred between foreigners of different countries. Such transfers may occur any number of times and are conceded among the figures for U.S. transactions opposite individual countries. Hence, the geographical breakdown shows only the country of domicile of the foreign buyers and sellers of securities in a particular round of transactions.

NOTE: Current and historical data on United States transactions with foreigners in long-term securities and on the gross foreign liabilities and claims reported by banks in the United States are available on the Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system website: http://www.ustreas.gov/tic. These data may be downloaded as separate time series for each country or geographical area regularly shown in the capital movements tables. Also available on this website is a table on “Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities,” showing estimated total holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes for current and recent periods. All data series on the TIC website are updated on the last business day of each month.

CHART CM-A.—U.S. Liabilities to Foreigners Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

In the first half of 2000, U.S. banking liabilities grew slightly faster than in 1998 and 1999. Liabilities in creased $40 billion, primarily due to a $61 billion increase opposite the Caribbean financial centers.

U.S. banking liabilities to foreigners, excluding long-term securities, are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that nearly one-half of U.S. banking liabilities currently is re ported opposite the United Kingdom and the banking centers in the Caribbean. Foreigners domiciled in the rest of Europe and in Asia hold an additional 40 per cent.

U.S. banking liabilities in the mid-1990s went through a growth spurt. The annual growth rate between 1993 and 1997 averaged 10 per cent. Growth in 1998 and 1999 slowed to less than 5 per cent per year, which is more in line with the 1989 through 1992 period.

CHART CM-B.—U.S. Claims on Foreigners Reported by U.S. Banks, Brokers and Dealers with Respect to Selected Countries

The first quarter of 2000 showed continued strong growth in banking claims on foreigners. Claims increased $61 billion, primarily due to a $76 billion increase in claims opposite Europe.

U.S. banking claims on foreigners, excluding long-term securities, are concentrated in international financial centers. The data on this page show that over three-quarters of U.S. claims currently are re ported opposite the United King dom, "All other Eu rope," and the bank ing centers in the Caribbean. Foreigners domiciled in Asia hold less than 10 per cent of U.S. claims, down from 20 per cent at the end of 1996.

After extremely strong growth in the mid-1990s, total U.S. banking claims on foreigners are leveling off. Annual growth peaked at 15 per cent in 1997. In 1998 and the first three quarters of 1999, claims grew at a much slower annual rate of 3 per-cent. For 1999 as a whole, bank ing claims in creased $59 billion, or 6 per cent, be cause of strong growth in the fourth quarter.

CHART CM-C.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Domestic Securities by Foreigners, Selected Countries

U.S. banks, brokers, and other persons or port foreigners' transactions in long-term U.S. securities (that is, U.S. Treasury and Government agency bonds and notes, and U.S. corporate bonds and stocks), which are conducted largely through international financial centers. The data on this page present aggregate net purchases on an annual basis for 1997 through 1999, as well as activity for the first half of 2000. The figures show that foreigners' annual net purchases (gross purchases minus gross sales) of U.S. securities have maintained an extremely high level since 1996.

An nual net for eign pur chases of U.S. se curi ties first sur passed $100 billion in 1993. They reached a re cord high of $388 bil lion in 1997. Since then, annual net pur chases have av er aged about $315 bil lion. Net pur chases were very strong in the first half of 2000, amount ing to $228 bil lion, of which $151 bil lion was re ported op posite Europe.

Over the past few years, the composition of foreigners' net purchases has changed dramatically. In the mid-1990s, the majority of foreigners' net purchases consisted of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes. Since 1997, however, foreigners increasingly have turned to other long-term securities.

CHART CM-D.—Net Purchases of Long-Term Foreign Securities by U.S. Investors *

The data on this page represents U.S. inventors' purchases and sales of long-term foreign securities as reported to the Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system. However, in the past 2 years, U.S. inventors also have acquired a substantial amount of foreign stocks, mostly European, through mergers that involve stock swaps. Net acquisitions through stock swaps amounted to $86 billion in 1998, $114 billion in 1999, and about $29 billion in the first half of 2000. These stock swaps are not reported under the TIC reporting system.

Taking into ac count the stock swaps, an nual U.S. net pur chases of long-term fore ign se curi ties have av er aged about $100 bil lion since the mid-1990s, with out much vari a tion from year to year. In 1999, net stock pur chases, in clud- ing the stock swaps, to taled about $95 bil lion, mostly through Eu rope and Jap an. Net bond pur chases to- taled $6 bil lion, far be low the lev- els of the mid-1990s. In the first half of 2000, tak ing into ac count the $29 bil lion in for eign stock ac quired through merg ers, U.S. residents ac quired approximately $36 bil lion in fore ign se curi ties, some what be low the pace of pre vi- ous years.

INTRODUCTION: Foreign Currency Positions

The “Treasury Bullion” reports for eigen currency holdings of large foreign exchange market participants. These reports provide information on positions in derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange futures and options, that are increasingly used in establishing foreign exchange positions but were not covered in the old reports.

The information is based on re ports of large for eign ex-change market par tic i pants on hold ings of six major for eign currencies (Canadian dollar, German mark, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, pound ster ling and Euro) and the U.S. dol lar. For-eign cur rency po si tions in the U.S. dol lar, which have been collected since January 1999, are intended to approx i mate "all other" currency positions of reporting institutions. U.S.-based businesses file a consolidated report for their domestic and foreign subsidiaries, branches and agencies. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign entities file only for themselves, not for their foreign parents. Filing is required by law (31 United States Code 5315; 31 Code of Federal Reg u la tions 128, Subpart C).

Weekly and monthly reports must be filed through out the calendar year by major foreign exchange market participants which are defined as market participants with more than $50 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any calendar quarter during the previous year (end March, June, September or December). Such contracts include the amounts of foreign exchange spot contracts bought and sold, for foreign exchange forward contracts bought and sold, for foreign exchange futures bought and sold, and one half the notional amount of foreign exchange options bought and sold. Exemptions from filing the monthly report are given to banking institutions that file the Federal Financial Institution

tion Examination Council (FFIEC) 035 report (“Monthly ConsolidatedForeignCurrencyReport”).

A quarterly report must be filed throughout the calendar year by each foreign exchange market participant that had more than $1 billion equivalent in foreign exchange contracts on the last business day of any quarter the previous year (end March, June, September or December). Exemptions from filing the quarterly report are given to major nonbank market participants that file weekly and monthly reports and banking institutions that file FFIEC 035 reports.

This information is published in seven sections corresponding to each of the major currencies covered by the reports. Tables I-1 through VII-1 present the currency data reported weekly by major market participants. Tables I-2 through VII-2 present more detailed currency data of major market participants, based on monthly Treasury and FFIEC 035 reports. Tables I-3 through VII-3 present quarterly consolidated currency data reported by large market participants and FFIEC reporters that do not file weekly reports.

Principal exchanged under cross-currency interest rate swaps is re ported as part of pur chases or sales of for eign exchange. Such prin ci pal also was noted sep arately on monthly and quarterly re ports through De cember 1998, when this prac- tice was discontinued. The net options position, or the net delta-equivalent value of an options position, is an esti mate of the re lation ship be tween an option’s value and an equiv alent currency hedge.

INTRODUCTION: Exchange Stabilization Fund

To stabilize the exchange value of the dollar, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) was established under the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934 (31 United States Code 5302), which authorized establishment of a Treasury fund to be operated under the exclusive control of the Secretary, with approval of the President.

Subsequent amendment of the Gold Reserve Act modified the original purpose some what to reflect termination of the fixed exchange rate system.

Resources of the fund include dollar balances, partially invested in U.S. Government securities, special drawing rights (SDRs), and balances of foreign currencies. Principal sources of income (+) or loss (-) for the fund are profits (+) or losses (-) on SDRs and foreign exchange, as well as interest earned on assets.

Table ESF-1 presents the assets, liabilities and capital of the fund. The figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents based on current exchange rates computed according to the accrual method of accounting. The capital account represents the original capital appropriated to the fund by Congress of $2 billion, minus a subsequent transfer of $1.8 billion to pay for the initial U.S. quota subscription to the International Monetary Fund. Gains and losses are reflected in the cumulative net income (+) or loss (-) account.

Table ESF-2 shows the results of operations by quarter. Figures are in U.S. dollars or their equivalents computed according to the accrual method. "Profit (+) or loss (-) on foreign exchange" includes realized profits or losses. "Adjustment for change in valuation of SDR holdings and allocations" reflects net gain or loss on revaluation of SDR holdings and allocations for the quarter.

Accrued discount (SBN-1, -2, -3)—Interest that accumulates on savings bonds from the date of purchase until the date of redemption or final maturity, whichever comes first. Series A, B, C, D, E, EE, F, I and J are discount or accrual type bonds—meaning principal and interest are paid when bonds are redeemed. Series G, H, HH and K are current-income bonds, and the semiannual interest paid to their holders is not included in accrued discount.

Amounts outstanding and in circulation (USCC)—Includes all is sues by the Bu reau of the Mint pur posely in tended as a me dium of ex change.

Budget authority ("Federal Fiscal Operations")—Congress passes laws giving budget authority to Government entities, which gives the agencies the power to spend Federal funds. Congress can stipulate various criteria for the spending of these funds. For example, Congress can stipulate that a given agency must spend within a specific year, number of years, or any time in the future.

The basic forms of budget authority are appropriations, authority to borrow, contract authority, and authority to obligate and expend off setting receipts and collections. The period of time during which Congress makes funds available may be specified as 1-year, multi-ple-year or no-year. The available amount may be classified as either definite or indefinite; a specific amount or an unspecified amount can be made available. Authority may also be classified as current or permanent. Permanent authority requires no current action by Congress.

Budget deficit—The to tal, cu mu lative amount by which bud- get outlays (spending) exceed budget receipts (income).

As of June 2000, the debt limit was $5,950,000 million; the limit may change from year to year.

The debt subject to limitation in cludes most of Treasury's public debt except securities issued to the Federal Financing Bank, upon which there is a limitation of $15 billion, and certain categories of older debt (totaling approximately $595 million as of February 1991).

Discount—The in ter est de ducted in ad vance when pur chasing notes or bonds. (See Ac crued dis count.)
