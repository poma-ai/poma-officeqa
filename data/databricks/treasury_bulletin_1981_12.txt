FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS

"Obligations" are the basis on which the use of funds is controlled in the Federal Government. They are recorded at the point at which the Government makes a firm commitment to acquire goods or services and are the first of the four key events-order, delivery, payment, consumption-which characterize the acquisition and use of resources. In general, they consist of orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions requiring the disbursement of money.

The obligational stage of Government transactions is a strategic point in gauging the impact of the Government's operations on the national economy, since it frequently represents for business firms the Government commitment which stimulates business investment, including inventory purchases and employment of labor. Disbursements may not occur for months after the Government places its order but the order itself usually causes immediate pressure on the private economy.

Obligations are classified according to a uniform set of categories which are based upon the nature of the transaction without regard to its ultimate purpose. All payments for salaries and wages, for example, are reported as personnel compensation, whether the personal services are used in current operations or in the construction of capital items.

Federal agencies and firms often do business with one another; in doing so, the "buying" agency records obligations, and the "performing" agency records reimbursements. In Table FO-1, obligations that are incurred within the Government are distinguished from those incurred outside the Government. Tables FO-2 and 3 show only those incurred outside.

Obligation data for the administrative budget fund accounts were first published in the September 1967 Treasury Bulletin and the trust fund accounts were first published in the October 1967 Bulletin. Beginning with the April 1968 Bulletin, the data are on the basis of the budget concepts adopted pursuant to the recommendations of the President's Commission on Budget Concepts.

The July 1981 obligations data is not included in this issue due to certain unavoidable delays in processing. This data will be published in subsequent Bulletins.

ACCOUNT OF THE U.S. TREASURY

Source and Availability of the Balance in the Account of the U.S. Treasury

The operating cash of the Treasury is maintained in Treasury's accounts with the Federal Reserve banks and branches and in tax loan accounts. As the balances in the accounts at the Federal Reserve Banks become depleted, they are restored by calling in (Withdrawing) funds from thousands of financial institutions throughout the country authorized to maintain tax and loan accounts.

Under authority of P.L. 95-147, the Treasury implemented a program on November 2, 1978, to invest a portion of its operating cash in obligations of depositories maintaining tax and loan accounts. Under the Treasury Tax and Loan investment program, depository financial institutions select the manner in which they will participate in the program. Depositaries that wish to retain funds deposited in their tax and loan accounts in interest-bearing obligations participate under the Note Option; depositaries that wish to remit the funds to the Treasury's account at Federal Reserve bank participate under the Remittance Option.

Deposits to tax and loan accounts occur in the normal course of business under a uniform procedure applicable to all financial institutions whereby customers of financial institutions deposit with them tax payments and funds for the purchase of Government securities. In most cases the transaction involves merely the transfer of funds from a customer's account to the tax and loan account in the same financial institution. On occasions, to the extent authorized by the Treasury, financial institutions are permitted to deposit in these accounts proceeds from subscriptions to public debt securities entered for their own account as well as for the accounts of their customers.

The tax and loan system premits the Treasury to collect fund through financial institutions and to leave the funds in Note Option depositaries and in the financial communities in which they arise until such time as the Treasury needs the funds for its operations. In this way the Treasury is able to neutralize the effect of its fluctuation operations on Note Option financial institution reserves and the economy.

Note: The computed annual interest charge represents the amount of interest that would be paid if each interest-bearing issue outstanding at the end of each month or year should remain outstanding for a year at the applicable annual rate of interest.
The aggregate charge for all interest-bearing issues constitutes the total computed annual interest charge. The average annual rate is computed by dividing the computed annual interest charge for the total or for any group of issues by the corresponding principal amount. The computation is based on

the rate of effective yield for issue sold at premium or discount. 1/ Includes Federal Financing Bank. 2/ Excludes Federal Financing Bank. 3/ Included in debt outstanding at face amount, but discount value is used in computing annual interest charge and annual interest rate. 4/ On United States savings bonds, the rate of maturity is applied against the amount outstanding.

Note: In these tables sales of Series A-F and J bonds are included at issue price, and redemptions and amoounts outstanding at current redemption value. Series G,H, HH and K are included at face value throughout. Matured bonds which have been redeemed are included in redemptions. Matured J and K bonds outstanding are included in the interest-bearing debt until all bonds of the annual series have matured, and are then transferred to matured debt on which interest has ceased.
1/ Sales and redemption figures include exchange of minor amounts of (1) matured Series E bonds for Series G and K bonds from May 1951 through April 1957; (2) Series F and J bonds for Series H bonds beginning January 1960; and (3) U.S. savings notes for Series H bonds beginning January 1972; however, they exclude exchanges of Series E bonds for Series H and HH bonds, which are reported in Table SB-3.
2/ Details by aeries on a cumulative basis and by perode of Series A-D combined will be found in the February 1952 and previous issues of the Treasury Bulletin.

3/ Because there is a normal lag in classifying redemptions, the distributions of redemption between sales price and accrued discount has been estimated.
4/ Series F and G sales were discontinued April 30, 1952, and Series J and K sales were discontinued April 30, 1957. Sales figures after April 30, 1957, represent adjustments.
5/ Includes exchanges of Series 1941 F and G bonds for 3-1/4% marketable bonds of 1978-83.
Includes exchanges of Series 1948 F and G savings bonds for 4-3/4% marketable notes of 1964.
Includes exchanges of Series 1949 F and G bonds for 4% marketable bonds of 1969.
Includes exchanges of Series 1960 F and G bonds for 3-7/8% marketable bonds of 1968.
6/ Includes exchanges of Series 1951 and 1952 F and G bonds for 3-7/8% marketable bonds of 1971 and 4% marketable bonds of 1980.
7/ Represents changes in the amounts of redemptions not yet classified between matured and unmatured issues.

TREASURY SURVEY OF OWNERSHIP

Monthly Treasury Survey of Ownership covers securities issued by the United States Government, Federal agencies, Federally-sponsored agencies, and the District of Columbia. The banks and insurance companies included in the Survey currently account for about 80 percent of all such securities held by these institutions. The similar proportion for corporations and for savings and loan associations is 50 percent, and for State and local governments, 40 percent. Data were first published for banks and insurance companies in the May 1941 Treasury Bulletin, for corporations and savings and loan association

in the September 1960 Bulletin, and for State and local governments in the February 1962 Bulletin.

Holdings by commercial bank distributed according to Federal Reserve member bank classes and nonmember banks are published for June 30 and December 31. Holdings by corporate pension trust funds are published quarterly, first appearing in the March 1954 Bulletin.

27 Includes gold sold to the United States by the International Monetary Fund with the right of repurchase, and gold deposited by the International Monetary Fund to mitigate the impact on the U.S. gold

stock of foreign purchases for the purpose of making gold subscriptions to the Fund under quota increases. For corresponding liabilities see Table IFS-2.

3/ Includes gold held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). See "Account of the U.S. Treasury," Table UST-3.

Note: The initial U.S. quota in the International Monetary Fund was $2,750 million. The U.S. quota was increased to $4,125 million in 1959, $5,160 million in February 1966, and $6,700 million in December 1970, and revalued to $7,274 million in May 1972 and $8,083 million in October 1973 as a result of changes in the par value of the dollar. In April 1978 the U.S. quota was increased in SDR terms from 6,700 million to 8,405 million; and in December 1980 to 12,608 million (in SDR terms).
1/ Represents net Fund sales of gold to acquire U.S. dollars for use in gold deposits or gold investment (see Table 1FS-2).
2/ Represents net loans made to the IMF under borrowing arrangements.
3/ Positive figures represent purchases from the Fund of currencies of other members for equivalent amounts of dollars; negative figures represent repurchases of dollars, including dollars derived from charges on purchases and from other net dollar income of the Fund. The United States has a commitment to repurchase within 3-5 years, but only to the extent that the Fund's holdings of dollars exceed the U.S. quota. Purchases of dollars by other countries reduce the U.S. commitment to repurchase by an equivalent amount.

This table presents calculations of weighted average percentage changes in the rates of exchange between the dollar and certain foreign currencies, in order to provide a measure of changes in the dollar's general foreign exchange value broader than a measure provided by any single exchange rate change. Calculations are provided for two sets of countries that account for a major share of U.S. foreign trade. U.S. bilateral trade patterns in 1972 are used as a convenient, readily available proxy for the assignment of relative weights to individual exchange rate changes, though such weights do not provide a full measure of individual currencies' relative importance in U.S. international transactions because they take no account of factors other than trade. The calculations do not purport to represent a guide to measuring the impact of exchange rate changes on U.S. international

Exchange rate data used in constructing the indices reported here differ somewhat from those used in earlier calculations to more accurately reflect end-of-period currency values.

The equations used are as follows:

Equation one is used to calculate a trade-weighted average of changes in the dollar cost of foreign currencies:

(EQ1) E_m = \Sigma ( \Delta \S / f c_i * M_i / \Sigma M )

Where: E_m is the weighted average of percentage changes in the dollar cost of individual foreign currencies;

$\Delta$/fc is the percent change in the dollar cost of foreign currency i; and

M_i/∑M is U.S. imports from country i, as a proportion of total U.S. imports from all countries in the set.

Equation two is used to calculate a trade-weighted average of changes

(EQ2) E_{X} \equiv \Sigma(\Delta f c_{i}/\xi * x_{i}/\Sigma x)

Where: Ex is the weighted average of percentage changes in the foreign currency cost of dollars;

$\Delta f c_{i}/$ is the percent change in the foreign currency i cost of dollars; and

X i /ΣX is U.S. exports to country i, as a proportion of total U.S. exports to all countries in the set.

Equation three combines the above export-weighted and import-weighted averages to provide an overall measure of exchange rate change:

(EQ 3) E = [ (E_m * m/m+x)*(-1) ] + [E_x * x/m+x]

Where: m/m+x is U.S. imports as a proportion of its total trade with all countries in the set; and

x/m+x is U.S. exports as a proportion of its total trade with all countries in the set.

2/ Australia, Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Canada, Demark, Finland, France Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,

3/ The currencies of 46 IMF member countries which account for approximately 90% of U.S. total trade.

CAPITAL MOVEMENTS

Background

Data relating to capital movements between the United States and foreign countries have been collected since 1935 under Treasury regulations pursuant to Executive Orders Nos. 6560 of January 15, 1934, and 10033 of February 8, 1949, and the International Investment Survey Act of 1976. Reports are filed with Federal Reserve banks by banks, bank holding companies, securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States. Statistics on the principal types of data by country or geographical area are then consolidated and are published in the monthly Treasury Bulletin.

The reporting forms and instructions 1/ used in the Treasury International Capital (TIC) Reporting System have been revised a number of times to meet changing conditions and to increase the usefulness of the published statistics. Revisions to the reporting forms are part of an ongoing effort to ensure the adequacy of the Treasury capital movements statistics for analysis and policy formulation with respect to the international financial position of the United States and on movements of capital between the United States and foreign countries. Revised forms and instructions are developed with the cooperation of other Government agencies and the Federal Reserve System and in consultations with representatives of banks, securities firms, and nonbanking enterprises.

Major revisions of the TIC B-series forms, filed by banks and some brokers in the United States, became effective with reports as of April 30, 1978; new data series were introduced in the July 1978 Treasury Bulletin. Also, effective March 1981, reporting coverage of the B-series forms was enlarged to include holdings by brokers and dealers of certain types of short-term money market instruments. Substantial revisions of the C-series forms, filed by nonbanking enterprises, were effective with reports as of December 31, 1978; the new data series are shown beginning with the June 1979 issue. Revisions of the TIC forms that affect the format and coverage of the current Capital Movements tables are noted under "Description of Statistics" below.

Basic Definitions

The term "foreigner" as used in the Treasury reports covers all institutions and individuals domiciled outside the United States including United States citizens domiciled abroad, and the foreign branches, subsidiaries, and offices of United States banks and business concerns; the central governments, central banks, and other official institutions of foreign countries, wherever located, and international and regional organizations, wherever located. The term "foreigner" also includes persons in the United States to the extent that they are known by reporting institutions to be acting on behalf of foreigners.

In general, data are reported opposite the foreign country or geographical area in which the foreigner is domiciled, as shown on the records of reporting institutions. For a number of reasons, the geographical breakdown of the reported data may not in all cases reflect the ultimate ownership of the assets. Reporting institutions are not expected to go beyond the addresses shown on their records, and so may not be aware of the country of domicile of the ultimate beneficiary. Furthermore, U.S. liabilities arising from deposits of dollars with foreign banks are reported generally in the Treasury statistics as liabilities to foreign banks, whereas the liability of the foreign bank receiving the deposit may be to foreign official institutions or to residents of another country.

Data pertaining to branches or agencies of foreign official institutions are reported opposite the country to which the official institution belongs. Data pertaining to international and regional organizations are reported opposite the appropriate international or regional classification except for the Bank for International Settlements which is included in the classification "Other Europe."

Geographical Classification

A number of changes in geographical classification were introduced for most Capital Movements tables in the July 1978 issue. Several countries formerly included in "Eastern Europe" and "Other Latin American Republics" are now shown separately in the country list as well as a new category in the "International and regional" grouping for "Middle Eastern Regional" in view of the proliferation of regional financial organizations in that area primarily in the Arab states. The remaining countries in the categories "Other Eastern Europe" and "Other Western Europe" were combined into a single "Other Europe" category; and the heading, "Latin America" was retitled "Latin America and Caribbean." To the extent possible, the statistics for earlier dates have been adjusted in accordance with these revised geographical categories.

Reporting Coverage

Reports are required from banks, bank holding companies, securities brokers and dealers, and nonbanking enterprises in the United States, including the branches, agencies, subsidiaries, and other affiliates in the United States of foreign firms. Entities that have reportable liabilities, claims, or securities transactions below specified exemption levels are exempt from reporting.

Banks and some brokers and dealers file reports monthly covering their dollar liabilities to, and dollar claims on, foreigners in a number of countries. Twice a year, as of June 30 and December 31, they also report the same liabilities and claims items with respect to foreigners in countries not shown separately on the monthly reports. Beginning with reports due as of June 30, 1978, quarterly reports are filed with respect to liabilities and claims denominated in foreign currencies vis-à-vis foreigners. The specified exemption level applicable to the monthly and quarterly reports is $2 million and is based on the average for the report dates during a six-month period, including the current report date. There is no separate exemption level for the semiannual reports.

Banks, securities brokers and dealers, and in some instances nonbanking enterprises report monthly their transactions in securities with foreigners: the applicable exemption level is $500,000 on the grand total of purchases and on the grand total of sales during the month covered by the report.

Quarterly reports are filed by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions other than banks and brokers, and other nonbanking enterprises if their liabilities or claims on the six-month average basis are $2 million or more. Beginning December 31, 1978, these firms also report for each month-end their U.S. dollar-denominated deposit and certificates of deposit claims on banks, abroad of $10 million or more.

Description of Statistics

Section I presents data in four tables on liabilities to foreigners reported by banks, brokers, and dealers in the United States. Beginning April 1978, amounts due to banks' own foreign offices are shown separately; the previous distinction between short-term and long-term liabilities has been eliminated; there is a separation of the liabilities of the respondents themselves from their custody liabilities to foreigners; and foreign currency liabilities are only reported quarterly. Also, beginning April 1978, the data on liabilities are made more complete by extending to securities brokers and dealers the requirement to report certain of their own liabilities and all of their custody liabilities to foreigners.

Table CM-I-1, showing total liabilities by type of foreign holder, combines liabilities previously shown separately as either short-term or long-term. Table CM-I-2, Parts A and B, on foreigners' holdings of liabilities by type show total liabilities payable in dollars reported by banks, brokers, and dealers. Table CM-I-3 presents total liabilities by country for recent periods and includes the long-term data previously shown separately; whereas CM-I-4, covering total liabilities by type and country for the most recent month, includes several data items not reported separately prior to April 1978. The liabilities data on supplementary countries previously presented in Table CM-I-5 now appear in Table CM-III-1. (See Section III below.)

Section II presents the claims on foreigners reported by banks in the United States. Beginning with data reported as of the end of April 1978, banks' claims held for their own account are reported separately from claims held for their domestic customers. The former are available in a monthly series whereas the latter data are collected on a quarterly basis only. Also, there is no longer a breakdown available on the long-term and short-term components of banks' claims. Maturity data are collected quarterly on a time remaining to maturity basis as opposed to the historic original maturity classification. Foreign currency claims are also collected only on a quarterly basis. Beginning March 1981, this claims coverage was extended to certain items in the hands of brokers and dealers in the United States.

Table CM-11-1 presents total claims by type as reported on the old A-series forms and has been revised to include the long-term claim components formerly published separately. Table CM-11-2, showing total claims by type, is based on the revised banking reports. Table CM-11-3 which represents total claims by country, merges the previously reported short-term and long-term claims data from old CM-11-2 and CM-11-5. New Tables CM-11-4 through CM-11-7 are based on the revised reports and replace the previous tables which showed short-term and long-term claims separately.

Another important change in the claims reporting, beginning with new quarterly data as of June 30, 1978, is the adoption of a broadened concept of "foreign public borrower," which replaces the previous category of "foreign official institution" to produce more meaningful information on lending to the public sector of foreign countries. The term "foreign public borrower" encompasses central governments and departments of central governments of foreign countries and of their possessions; foreign central banks, stabilization funds, and exchange authorities; corporations and other agencies of central governments, including development banks, development institutions and other agencies which are majority-owned by the central government or its departments; State, provincial, and local governments of foreign countries and their departments and agencies; and any international or regional organization or subordinate or affiliated agency thereof, created by treaty or convention between sovereign states.

Section III includes two supplementary tables on U.S. banks' liabilities to, and claims on, foreigners. Table CM-III-1 summarizes dollar liabilities to, and banks' own dollar claims on, countries and areas not regularly reported separately. Beginning with reports due as of June 30, 1978, these data are collected semiannually. Previously, the semiannual reports were addressed to liabilities items only and were reported as of April and December; however, they are now collected as of the end of June and December. Table CM-III-2 presents data on U.S. banks' loans and credits to nonbank foreigners, based on the TIC reports and on the monthly Federal Reserve 2507 reports submitted for foreign branches of U.S. banks.

Sections IV and V, respectively, show the liabilities to, and claims on, unaffiliated foreigners by exporters, importers, industrial and commercial concerns, financial institutions other than banks and brokers, and other nonbanking enterprises in the United States. The data exclude the intercompany accounts of nonbanking enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies. (Such transactions are reported by business enterprises to the Department of Commerce on its direct investment forms.) The data also exclude claims held through banks in the United States. Beginning with data published in June 1979 (reported as of December 31, 1978), there is separation of the financial liabilities and claims of reporting enterprises from their commercial liabilities and claims; and items are collected on a time-remaining basis instead of the prior original maturity basis. In addition, the number of reporters increased somewhat as a result of a broad canvass of prospective reporters undertaken in late 1978.

In Section IV, Table CM-IV-1 combines liabilities previously shown as either short-term or long-term in old Table CM-IV-1. Table CM-IV-2 combines these short-term and long-term liabilities by country and replaces previous Tables CM-IV-2 and CM-IV-4. Table CM-IV-3, covering total liabilities by type and country for the most recent quarter-end, includes several items not reported separately prior to December 1978.

The tables in Section V have been extensively revised to reflect the changes in data collection format outlined above and the elimination of a monthly form that covered nonbanking enterprises' liquid claims on foreigners. Specifically, Table CM-V-1 combines short-term and long-term claims; Table CM-V-2 shows total claims by country and replaces former Tables CM-V-2 and CM-V-7. Current Table CM-V-3 shows total claims by type and country and includes items that were not reported separately prior to end-year 1978. Tables CM-V-4, CM-V-5, and CM-V-6 no longer appear.

Section VI contains data on transactions in all types of long-term domestic and foreign securities by foreigners as reported by banks and brokers in the United States (except nonmarketable U.S. Treasury notes, foreign series, and nonmarketable U.S. Treasury bonds and notes, foreign currency series, which are shown in the "International Financial Statistics" section, Table IFS-4). The data cover new issues of securities, transactions in outstanding issues, and redemptions of securities. They include transactions executed in the United States for the account of foreigners, and transactions executed abroad for the account of reporting institutions and their domestic customers. The data include some transactions which are classified as direct

investments in the balance of payments accounts. The data excludes securities issued abroad by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, some of which are treated in the balance of payments as issues of U.S. corporations.

The geographical breakdown of the data on securities transactions shows the country of domicile of the foreign buyers and sellers of the securities; in the case of outstanding issues, this may differ from the country of the original issuer. The gross figures contain some offsetting transactions between foreigners. The net figures for total transactions represent transactions by foreigners with United States residents; but the net figures for transactions of individual countries and areas may include some transactions between foreigners of different countries. Beginning with data for 1969, transactions between foreigners in new issues not offered for sale to United States residents but managed by underwriters in the United States are excluded from the gross figures.

The data published in these sections do not cover all types of reported capital movements between the United States and foreign countries. The principal exclusions are the intercompany capital transactions of business enterprises in the United States with their own branches and subsidiaries abroad or with their foreign parent companies, and capital transactions of the United States Government. Consolidated data on all types of international capital transactions are published by the Department of Commerce in its regular reports on the United States balance of payments.

1/ Copies of the reporting forms and instructions may be obtained from the Office of International Financial Reports, Office of the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220, or from Federal Reserve banks.

FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS

Background

Data have been collected since 1974 on the foreign currency positions of banks and nonbanking firms in the United States, and on those of foreign branches, majority-owned foreign partnerships, and majority-owned foreign subsidiaries of U. S. banks and nonbanking firms. Reports cover eight major foreign exchange market currencies and U. S. dollars held abroad. Reporting has been required pursuant to title II of Public Law 93-110, an amendment to the Par Value Modification Act of September 21, 1973, and implementing Treasury regulations. Statistics on the positions have been published monthly since March 1977 beginning with data for December 1975. The report forms and instructions used in the collection of bank data were revised effective with reports as of November 1, 1978, for the weekly reports, and as of October 31, 1978 (the last business day of the month), for the monthly reports. The most recent revision of the nonbank foreign currency forms (see below) became effective as of the last business day of September 1978. Among the changes on the forms, the Belgian franc was deleted as a reporting currency.

Common Definitions and Concepts

The term "United States" means the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Canal Zone, Midway Island, the Virgin Islands, and Wake Island. The term "foreign" means locations other than the "United States." The term "worldwide" is used to describe the sum of "United States" and "foreign" data.

Data for the United States include amounts reported by sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations in the United States including the U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign nonbanking concerns, in the case of "nonbanking firms' positions," and the agencies, branches, and subsidiaries located in the United States of foreign banks and banking institutions, in the case of the weekly and monthly "bank positions."

Data for "foreign branches" and "abroad" include amounts reported by the branches, majority-owned partnerships and majority-owned subsidiaries of U.S. banking and nonbanking concerns. In general, these data do not reflect the positions of foreign parents or foreign parents' subsidiaries located abroad except through intercompany accounts. The data include the foreign subsidiaries of a few foreign-owned U.S.-based corporations.

Assets, liabilities, and foreign exchange contract data are reported on the basis of time remaining to maturity as of the date of the report, regardless of the original maturity of the instrument

involved. "Spot" means due for receipt or delivery within 2 business days from the date of the report. "Short-term" means maturing in 1 year or less from the date of the report.

"Majority-owned foreign partnerships" are those organized under the laws of a foreign country in which one or more nonbanking concerns or nonprofit institutions in the United States, directly or indirectly, own more than 50 percent profit interest. "Majority-owned foreign subsidiaries" are foreign corporations in which one or more nonbanking business concerns or nonprofit institutions located in the United States directly or indirectly own stock with more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or more than 50 percent of the total value of all classes of stock.

Reporting Threshold

The exemption level applicable to banks and banking institutions is $10 million equivalent. The exemption level applicable to nonbanking business concerns and nonprofit institutions was $1 million equivalent on all nonbank forms from March 1975 through November 1976. It was raised to $2 million equivalent on the monthly reports of positions held in the United States. From November 1976 through September 1978 the exemption level was raised to $3 million on foreign subsidiary positions on June 31, 1977, and for positions held in the United States on September 30, 1978.

Firms must report their entire foreign currency position in a specified foreign currency if a specified U.S. dollar equivalent value is reached in any category of assets, liabilities, exchange contracts bought and sold, or the net position in the currency. In general, exemption levels are applied to the entire firm in the United States and separately to each foreign branch or subsidiary. In reports on their foreign branches, majority-owned foreign partnerships and majority-owned foreign subsidiaries, U.S. banks and nonbanks are required to report the U.S. dollar-denominated assets, liabilities, exchange contracts bought and sold, and net positions of those branches, partnerships, and subsidiaries with reportable positions in the specified foreign currencies.

Description of Statistics

Data collected on the Treasury foreign currency forms are published in the Treasury Bulletin in nine sections. The first section presents a summary of worldwide net positions in all of the currencies reported. Sections II through VIII each present data on a Specified foreign currency. Section IX presents the U.S. dollar positions of the foreign branches and subsidiaries of U.S. firms which are required to report in one or more of the specified foreign currencies.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES ACQUIRED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITHOUT PAYMENT OF DOLLARS

Foreign currencies reported herein in U.S. dollar equivalents were acquired without direct payment of dollars, for the most part in connection with foreign assistance and agricultural trade development programs authorized by various provisions of law. These currencies are generally referred to as "nonpurchased" foreign currencies to distinguish them from currencies purchased with dollars from banks or other commercial sources. The currencies are held in the custody of the Department of the Treasury until such time as they are either sold for dollars to Government agencies or transferred to Government agencies for expenditure without charge to appropriations, as specifically authorized by law.

Prior to July 1, 1953, foreign currencies acquired by Government agencies without direct payment of dollars generally were available to the collecting agencies to defray operating expenses and were not subject to the regular appropriation processes.

The act of July 15, 1952, Sec. 1415 (66 Stat. 662), provided that after June 30, 1953, U.S. agencies could no longer expend foreign currencies belonging to the U.S. Government except as provided annually in appropriation acts. Subsequent legislation required executive departments and agencies, with certain exceptions, to reimburse the Treasury in dollars for the foreign currencies used. Executive Orders No. 10488 dated September 23, 1953, and No. 10900 dated January 5, 1961, as amended, provided for the issuance of regulations by the Secretary of the Treasury governing the purchase, custody, deposit, transfer, and sale of foreign exchange by all Executive Departments and agencies of the U.S. Government

Accordingly, Treasury Circular No. 930 was issued on October 19, 1953, effective December 1, 1953. These regulations provided for the transfer of department and agency foreign currency balances as of November 30, 1953,

into Treasury custody, and the flow of future collections through Treasury accounts; and established requirements with respect to withdrawals from Treasury accounts; limitations on purchases and amounts of holdings; the use of foreign depositaries; and accounting for the currencies. Treasury Circular No. 930, Revised, June 8, 1978, and corresponding instructions in Volume I of the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, T FERM 2-3200 now cover foreign currency accounting and reporting.

Figures are stated in dollar equivalents, computed for reporting purposes, to provide a common denominator for the currencies of the many foreign countries involved. It should not be assumed that dollars, in amounts equal to the balances, are actually available for the general use of the balances, are actually available for the general use of the U.S. Government, since most of the currencies are nonconvertible and restricted as to uses by the terms of agreements between the United States and the foreign governments.

The tables exclude the counterpart funds owned by and held in accounts of the foreign governments. The use of such funds is subject to approval of the United States, and transactions therein are included in reports of the Agency for International Development. The tables also exclude the U.S. purchases of foreign currencies which are under dollar accountability and reported as dollar transactions.

Detailed data, by account, agency, program, foreign country, unit of currency, and related dollar equivalents, were published annually in the Combined Statement of Receipts, Expenditures and Balances, from fiscal 1958 through 1969. Beginning with fiscal 1970, only summary data by country and account are shown in the Combined Statement; however, detailed data are published semiannually in the report, Foreign Currencies Held by the U.S. Government.
